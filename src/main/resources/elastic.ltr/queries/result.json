It is measured at current basic prices, which include the effect of inflation, excluding taxes (less subsidies) on products (for example, Value Added Tax). GVA plus taxes (less subsidies) on products is equivalent to gross domestic product (GDP). \n\nThese regional estimates of gross value added are measured using the income approach, sometimes denoted by GVA(I). This involves adding up the income generated by UK resident individuals or corporations in the production of goods and services. It is calculated gross of deductions for consumption of fixed capital, which is the amount of fixed assets used up in the process of production in any period. We also publish [experimental estimates of GVA measured using the production approach][1], with the effect of inflation removed.\n\nThese estimates are consistent with the [National Accounts Blue Book 2016][2]. National aggregates for the components of GVA are allocated to regions using the most appropriate regional indicator available. \n\nGVA estimates in this bulletin are available at three geographical levels, in accordance with the [NUTS classification][3] which came into force on 1 January 2015. The Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics (NUTS) provides a single uniform breakdown for the production of regional statistics for the EU:\n\nNUTS1: Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the nine English regions<br>\nNUTS2: 40 sub-regions – mainly groups of counties and unitary authorities<br>\nNUTS3: 173 local areas – principally individual counties and unitary authorities the term Extra-Regio is applied to economic activity that cannot be assigned to any specific region within a country\n\nFurther information can be found in chapter 1 of the [regional accounts methodology guide][4].\n\nThe GVA(I) estimates presented here are on a workplace basis (allocated to the location where the economic activity takes place). GVA(I) per head of population is a useful way of comparing regions of different size and is an important indicator for both domestic and European policy purposes. Total GVA(I) estimates in millions of pounds (£m) are divided by the total resident population of a region (including the economically inactive) to give GVA per head in pounds (£). While GVA(I) per head can be a useful way of comparing regions of different size, comparisons can be affected by commuting flows into or out of the region.\n\nThese regional GVA estimates update [those published in December 2015 for the period 1997 to 2014][5]. Additionally, provisional estimates for the year 2015 are released for the first time. These figures are provisional as national estimates have not been through Supply and Use balancing at the time of this publication. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/bulletins/regionalgrossvalueaddedproductionapproach/1998to2013\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/compendium/unitedkingdomnationalaccountsthebluebook/2016edition\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/geographicalproducts/namescodesandlookups/namesandcodeslistings/namesandcodesforeurostatgeography\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/regionalaccounts/grossdisposablehouseholdincome/methodologies/regionalaccounts/regionalaccountsmethodologyguideaugust2016.pdf\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/bulletins/regionalgrossvalueaddedincomeapproach/december2015","title":"Things you need to know about this release"},{"markdown":"In 2015 gross value added (GVA) per head for the UK as a whole was £25,601. With Extra-Regio and the statistical discrepancy excluded, the UK per head figure was £25,351. Of the four UK countries, only England had a higher GVA per head value at £26,159. Wales had the lowest GVA per head at £18,002, but its growth between 2014 and 2015 was the highest at 2.8%. The lowest growth was in Northern Ireland at 1.4%.\n\n<ons-table path=\"00aeee2d\" />\n\nIn 2015 GVA per head of population increased in all NUTS1 regions. The largest percentage increase was in the North West at 3.0%, just ahead of the North East and Wales, both at 2.8%. The East Midlands had the smallest percentage increase at 1.0%, followed by Northern Ireland at 1.4%. \n\nA similar pattern can be seen in the employment rates (for those aged 16 to 64) for 2015, which rose in all regions except Yorkshire and The Humber and the East Midlands. The North West saw the largest increase, from 70.9% to 73.2%, and the second largest was in Wales, from 69.2% to 71.4%. Unemployment decreased strongly in many UK regions in 2015; it fell by more than a percentage point in the North West, Wales and the East of England. By contrast, there were very small increases in the unemployment rate in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Yorkshire and The Humber and the North East.\n\nThe economic downturn experienced in the UK in late 2008 and 2009 affected all NUTS1 regions. Looking at growth in UK GVA per head (excluding Extra-Regio and statistical discrepancy), the UK economy grew by 2.1% in 2015. This was slower than in 2014, when the UK grew by 4.2%, the fastest rate since the UK returned to growth following the 2009 economic downturn. \n\nFigure 1 shows the annual rate of growth in regional GVA(I) per head for each NUTS1 region across the period 1997 to 2015. \n\nClick on the region names above the chart to toggle the lines on and off.\n \n<ons-chart path=\"277d1e13\" />\n\nWhile each region saw a decline in rate of growth in 2009, their paths of recovery from 2009 to 2015 have varied. The rate of growth in Scotland reached its lowest point in 2010, with a decrease of 2.2%. In 2010 all other regions showed higher annual growth than they had in the previous year. Since the economic downturn in 2009 the highest annual growth seen in any region was 6.2% in London in 2014.\n\nIn addition to GVA per head, the North West was also the fastest growing NUTS1 region in the UK in 2015 when looking at total GVA (in millions of pounds). Total GVA in the North West grew by 3.6% from £151,385 in 2014 to £156,872 in 2015. East Midlands had the lowest rate of growth in total GVA at 1.8% in 2015.\n\nFigure 2 shows each region’s share of the UK total including Extra-Regio. London had the highest share of UK GVA in 2015, with 22.7%, followed by the South East with 14.9%. The lowest share after Extra-Regio (1.0%) was Northern Ireland, with 2.1%, followed by the North East with 3.0%.\n \n<ons-chart path=\"5fca534f\" />\n\nAlthough most regions’ shares of total GVA haven’t changed greatly since the start of the time series in 1997, London has increased its share by 4.0 percentage points. The South East has also increased, by 0.1 percentage points. All other regions decreased, with the West Midlands and Extra-Regio decreasing the most, by 0.8 percentage points.\n\nRegional GVA estimates provide a comprehensive industry breakdown, with activities grouped into 20 sections (with a further 13 manufacturing sub-sections) in accordance with the [Standard Industrial Classification 2007 (SIC 2007)][1]. \n\nIt should be noted that all 2015 industry data in this release are provisional as they are based on national data that have not been through the Supply and Use balancing process. The provisional industry estimates for regions compiled using the income approach will not sum to those published in the UK National Accounts, compiled using the output approach. The difference is shown in the statistical discrepancy that can be found in the reference tables released with this bulletin. \n\nThe North West was the fastest growing NUTS1 region in 2015. Looking at the industrial composition of the North West for broad industry groupings, information and communication (9.0%), distribution, transport, accommodation and food (5.5%) and real estate activities (4.9%) all performed strongly between 2014 and 2015.\n \nFigure 3 shows the industrial composition of total GVA for each NUTS1 region in 2015 for broad industry groupings. Looking at the growth between 2014 and 2015:\n\n- information and communication was the strongest growing industry in the UK (6.9%); the North East (14.9%), South East (10.8%) and North West (9.0%) all performed strongly in this industry\n- agriculture, mining and the utilities (electricity, gas and water) decreased in 2015 in all regions except Wales (5.1%) and the East Midlands (0.6%)\n- the construction industry grew in most regions in 2015, with the exception of London (negative 3.8%), South East (negative  1.5%) and Wales (negative  1.2%)\n- the public service industries also showed growth across most of the NUTS1 regions, with the highest in the South East (8.4%); a decrease was seen in the West Midlands (negative 0.4%) and Extra-Regio (negative  8.6%); Extra-Regio for the public service industries relates to UK forces and embassies staff stationed overseas\n\n<ons-chart path=\"79e2c7a0\" />\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007","title":"The North West was the fastest growing NUTS1 region in the UK in 2015"},{"markdown":"The ten NUTS3 local areas with the highest gross value added (GVA) per head and the ten with the lowest GVA per head in 2015 are displayed in table 2. \n\n<ons-table path=\"5d3de0ee\" />\n\nAll of the top ten NUTS3 local areas were in London, South East or Scotland NUTS1 regions, the top five of which were in London.

This is because it compares a workplace measure of economic output (GVA), which includes the contribution of in-commuters, with a residence-based denominator (population). For such areas it is advisable to refer to [ONS sub-regional productivity][1] data for a direct measure of economic performance.\n\nGVA per head increased in 151 of the 173 NUTS3 local areas between 2014 and 2015.

Figure 4 shows the highest and lowest local areas’ GVA per head within each region.\n\n<ons-image path=\"f1546b23\" />\n\nThe region with the most variation by far is London, where the difference between Redbridge and Waltham Forest and Camden and the City of London is £275,802 per head. The North East and Wales have the least amount of variation, with the differences between the highest and lowest local areas at £9,110 and £9,372 respectively.\n\nOutside of London, Belfast was the local area furthest away from its NUTS1 figure, with £16,439 per head more than Northern Ireland as a whole. Wales and the South West were the most evenly balanced, with the lowest and highest local areas being roughly the same distance from the NUTS1 figure.\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/articles/subregionalproductivity/march2016","title":"NUTS3 – GVA performance at the local area level"},{"markdown":"Use this interactive map to see how gross value added (GVA) per head varied across NUTS3 local areas in the years 1997 to 2015. \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc220/map.html\" />","title":"What was the average GVA in your local area?"},{"markdown":"Figure 5 shows annual growth in total GVA and GVA per head between 2014 and 2015 for a selection of the largest cities in the UK.

The difference in growth between total GVA and GVA per head is caused by changes in the resident population of the city.

In Inner London – West, GVA per head did not change from its value in 2014.\n\nThis NUTS2 sub-regional breakdown has an important function in being a legal requirement of the European Union (EU), which is used to inform the EU’s Cohesion Policy. This policy is aimed at “reducing disparities between the various regions” ([Eurostat][1]). The current funding period for this policy covers the years 2014 to 2020 and money is allocated to regions based on their percentage of the EU’s average gross domestic product (GDP) per head.\n\nSub-regions with a GDP per head of less than 75% of the EU average are eligible for funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund. In the latest funding round, covering 2014 to 2020, two UK regions were considered eligible: Cornwall and Isles of Scilly and West Wales and The Valleys.\n\nFigure 6 compares the GVA per head for the two regions eligible for funding as per head indices for the period 1997 to 2015. GVA per head indices show how a region compares with the UK average (where the UK is equal to 100).\n\n<ons-chart path=\"e6d28d4b\" />\n\nDespite being eligible for full EU funding in the 2007 to 2013 and 2014 to 2020 funding periods, both Cornwall and Isles of Scilly and West Wales and The Valleys have remained below the UK average in all years across the time series, with West Wales and The Valleys having the lowest GVA per head figure of all NUTS2 sub-regions in each of the years 1997 to 2015. Neither region has improved its performance across the time series, with both sub-regions moving relatively further away from the UK average since the start of the time period. \n\nHowever, in terms of growth in GVA per head between 2014 and 2015, both West Wales and The Valleys and Cornwall and Isles of Scilly have performed better than the UK average. Cornwall and Isles of Scilly grew by 3.3% and West Wales and The Valleys grew by 2.5% compared with a UK average of 2.1%. This meant that Cornwall and Isles of Scilly is no longer in the bottom 2 regions, and has moved to fourth from the bottom, as can be seen in table 3.\n\nThose sub-regions with a GDP per head between 75% and 90% of the EU average are eligible for transition funding, meaning they receive a smaller amount of funding. In the 2014 to 2020 funding period 11 UK regions were eligible for transition funding: Cumbria; Devon; East Yorkshire and Northern Lincolnshire; Highlands and Islands; Lancashire; Lincolnshire; Merseyside; Northern Ireland; Shropshire and Staffordshire; South Yorkshire; Tees Valley and Durham. \n\n\n  [1]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Regional_policies_and_Europe_2020","title":"NUTS2 – used to allocate EU structural funding"},{"markdown":"###Regional and sub-regional productivity \n\nGross value added (GVA) per head can be a useful way of comparing regions of different sizes. This is particularly the case where there are no large net-commuting effects, when GVA per head can act as a good proxy for measures of economic performance such as productivity. However, it is not such a good proxy for those areas with high net in- or out-commuting. This is because it compares a workplace measure of economic output (GVA), which includes the contribution of in-commuters, with a residence-based denominator (population). For such areas it is advisable to refer to ONS productivity data for a direct measure of economic performance. ONS estimates of regional and sub-regional productivity, based on the GVA data in this publication, will follow in a subsequent ONS bulletin. This bulletin, which for the first time will combine [Regional productivity][1] data and [productivity data for sub-regions][2], will be released on 6 January 2017.\n\n###Alternative measures of gross value added \n\nEstimates of GVA calculated using the income approach (GVA(I)) do not allow for different regional price levels or changes in prices over time (inflation). The income approach to calculating GVA produces only current price estimates because some income components cannot easily be converted into prices and volume (for example, gross operating surplus). We have developed a measure of [regional GVA calculated using the production approach][3] to allow estimates of real regional GVA to be published in chained volume measures. The next publication is scheduled for Friday 16 December 2016.\n\n###Regional gross disposable household income (GDHI)\n\nWhile regional GVA(I) estimates provide an indication of the economic activity happening within regions, it is not an indicator of wealth. We also produce estimates of [regional GDHI][4], which is the amount of money that individuals in the household sector have available for spending or saving and can therefore be considered a measure of wealth. Regional GDHI is a residence-based measure, meaning it allocates money to the areas in which people live. Further information on regional GDHI can be found in chapter 4 of the [regional accounts methodology guide][5].\n\n###Economic statistics for devolved administrations\n\nThe devolved administrations of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each produce economic statistics for their countries. \n\n- Welsh Government publishes an [Index of Market Services][6] and [Indices of Production and Construction][7].\n- Scottish Government publishes a number of economic measures as part of the [Scottish National Accounts Programme (SNAP)][8].\n- The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) publishes a [Northern Ireland Composite Economic Index][9] and a [Northern Ireland Economic Accounts Project][10] has developed experimental Supply and Use Tables for Northern Ireland.\n\nWe work with the devolved administrations through the Inter-Administration Committee (IAC) and its subsidiary the Devolved Economic Statistics Co-ordination group (DESC).\n\n### Alternative geographical breakdowns\n\nThese regional GVA(I) estimates are presented for NUTS1, NUTS2 and NUTS3 geographies, defined according to the European [Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statisitics (NUTS)][11].\n\nWe also publish estimates of [GVA(I) by Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP)][12]. GVA(I) for LEPs (consistent with this regional GVA(I) release) will be published in the first quarter of 2017. \n\nEstimates of [GVA(I) for English Local Authorities for 1997 to 2014][13] were published for the first time in May 2016. In spring 2017 we will publish data (consistent with this regional GVA(I) release) for all UK Local Authorities for 1997 to 2015.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/bulletins/labourproductivity/q32015\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/articles/subregionalproductivity/march2016\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/bulletins/regionalgrossvalueaddedproductionapproach/1998to2013\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/regionalaccounts/grossdisposablehouseholdincome/bulletins/regionalgrossdisposablehouseholdincomegdhi/2014\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/regionalaccounts/grossdisposablehouseholdincome/methodologies/regionalaccounts/regionalaccountsmethodologyguideaugust2016.pdf\n  [6]: http://gov.wales/statistics-and-research/index-market-services/?lang=en\n  [7]: http://gov.wales/statistics-and-research/index-production-construction/?lang=en\n  [8]: http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Economy/SNAP\n  [9]: https://www.economy-ni.gov.uk/articles/northern-ireland-composite-economic-index-nicei\n  [10]: https://www.economy-ni.gov.uk/articles/ni-economic-accounts-project\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/geographicalproducts/namescodesandlookups/namesandcodeslistings/namesandcodesforeurostatgeography\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/datasets/gvaforlocalenterprisepartnerships\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/adhocs/005715regionalgvaibylocalauthorityinengland1997to2014","title":"Links to related statistics "},{"markdown":"The UK National Accounts have included for the first time in Blue Book 2016 the Crossrail business rates supplement (BRS). This is a tax on production which has been levied from April 2010. The tax is collected on behalf of the Greater London Authority (GLA) by the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation. A regional indicator has been compiled using estimates published by the GLA of estimates of income from Crossrail BRS by London borough.\n\nIn keeping with the UK National Accounts commitment to meeting the European Commission definition of [Gross National Income][1] and the new [European System of Accounts (ESA2010)][2], there have been changes made to the UK National Accounts measure of gross value added (GVA). These impact upon the regional GVA estimates in the form of different national totals for the various components of income, even where no explicit changes to the regional allocation have been needed. Of these, a change to the treatment of [Owner-Occupied Imputed Rental][3] has resulted in the greatest impact on the national figures. \n\nA change has been made to show subsidies on production separately in this release. In previous releases, subsidies have been included in mixed income and profits, and allocated (that is, subtracted) from the profits of each of the sectors (households, public non-financial corporations and private non-financial corporations). In this release, each of the separate subsidies has been regionalised independently, in the same way that taxes on production are processed. The subsidies component can now be found in reference table 15.\n\nWe have carried out a review of the way we measure the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum industry (SIC Sub-section CD) in regional GVA and have made some changes to improve consistency with the reality of the industry. A discrepancy was found between the conversion to SIC 2007 in GVA(I) compared with the production measure (GVA(P)), with the GVA(P) conversion found to be the better of the two. Thus, the GVA(I) series has been re-converted, bringing the 2 measures closer together. Alongside this, extensive industry research has been carried out to influence adjustments made to the raw data to reflect reality as accurately as possible.\n\nIn last year’s release, there was a change in the average house prices used to calculate the regional allocation of imputed rental of owner-occupied dwellings. The new data used median house prices from ONS instead of mean house prices, which reduces the impact of the most expensive houses and improves the consistency of estimates over time. The exception at the time was Northern Ireland: mean house prices were used for Northern Ireland as median house prices were unavailable. We have now been able to source median house price data for Northern Ireland consistent with the rest of the UK regions and countries. This has had an impact on GVA estimates for Real Estate Activities (SIC Section L) in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n  [1]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Gross_national_income_(GNI)\n  [2]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-manuals-and-guidelines/-/KS-02-13-269\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/changestonationalaccounts/imputedrental","title":"What’s changed in this release?"},{"markdown":"Historically we have produced regional gross value added (GVA) by both the income approach (as National Statistics) and the production approach (as experimental statistics). We plan to take the strengths from both measures and use them to produce a new balanced measure of regional GVA. This will give users a single measure of economic activity within a region. A first set of results will be published for consultation in spring to summer 2017. Depending on the results of that consultation, we hope to publish all 3 measures alongside each other in December 2017, with the balanced data being the lead series.\n\nWe have published GVA(I) and gross disposable household income (GDHI) for local authorities in England in 2016. By the end of March 2017, we plan to extend the GVA(I) data to cover the whole of the UK, and the GDHI data by the end of July 2017. By September 2017 we plan to include “real” measures of GVA. Further work in 2017 and 2018 will look into the viability of disaggregating these local authority data further down into output areas for GDHI and workplace zones for GVA.\n\nWe have recently published a [feasibility study on regional household final consumption expenditure (HFCE)][1]. Producing this at a regional level would complete the suite of household accounts by measuring spending on consumer goods and services. It will also pave the way for a regional savings ratio. Work will be carried out in 2017 to further examine data sources and concepts, with an aim to produce regional HFCE in 2018. \n\nIn the next regional GVA(I) release we plan to take on an improved method for allocating owner occupied imputed rental (OOIR). In Blue Book 2016 the regional allocation of owner occupied dwelling was allocated using a data source available regionally, however the privately rented dwellings continued to use a data source which was only available nationally. For Blue Book 2017 national accounts intend to move to a regional-based data source for privately rented dwellings as well. We intend to implement these regional sources following Blue Book 2017.\n\nFurther details about our development programme are available in the article [Supporting devolution: developments in regional and local statistics][2].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/regionalaccounts/grossdisposablehouseholdincome/articles/thefeasibilityofproducingregionalhouseholdfinalconsumptionexpenditureuk/2016\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/regionalaccounts/grossdisposablehouseholdincome/articles/supportingdevolutiondevelopmentsinregionalandlocalstatistics/2016-05-25","title":"Future work plans"},{"markdown":"###Quality\n\nThe regional [GVA(I) Quality and Methodology Information][1] document contains important information on:\n\n- the strengths and limitations of the data\n- the quality of the output: including the accuracy of the data, how it compares with related data\n- uses and users\n- how the output was created\n\nFigures for 2015 are provisional as national estimates have not been through Supply and Use balancing at the time of this publication. Regional industry estimates for the components of income in 2015 have been calculated by applying growth in GDP(O) industry figures and then constraining these to sum to the income component totals. The figures used in this process are consistent with those published in the National Accounts Blue Book 2016.\n\nThe statistical discrepancy is the difference between the sum of the national income components and the definitive national estimate of GVA.\n\n###Methodology\n\nVarious [guidance and methodology documents][2] relating to regional GVA(I) are available on our website. The [regional accounts methodology guide][3] provides an overview of the methodology used to compile regional accounts outputs. Quality and methodology information (QMI) reports are available, covering the relevance, accuracy, timeliness, accessibility and coherence of each of the regional accounts outputs. Other historical guidance, methodology and update documents are also available.\n\n###Revisions\n\nRevisions to NUTS1, NUTS2 and NUTS3 regional GVA(I) estimates in this statistical bulletin cover the period 1997 to 2014.\n\nVery few statistical revisions arise as a result of errors in the popular sense of the word. All estimates, by definition, are subject to statistical error but in this context the word refers to the uncertainty in any process or calculation that uses sampling, estimation or modelling. Most revisions reflect either the adoption of new statistical techniques or the incorporation of new information which allows the statistical error of previous estimates to be reduced. Only rarely are there avoidable errors such as human or system errors and such mistakes are made clear when they are discovered and corrected.\n\nThe main reasons for revisions are detailed in the What’s changed in this release? section.\n\nRevisions to GVA estimates for 2014 are shown in table 4. Further detail is available in the [revisions triangles][4] on our website.\n\n<ons-table path=\"0b3f5c3b\" />\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/qmis/regionalgrossvalueaddedincomeapproachqmi\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/regionalaccounts/grossdisposablehouseholdincome/methodologies/regionalaccountsuserengagement\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/regionalaccounts/grossdisposablehouseholdincome/methodologies/regionalaccounts/regionalaccountsmethodologyguideaugust2016.pdf\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/datasets/regionalgrossvalueaddedincomeapproach/current/gvarevisionstriangles.xls","title":"Quality and methodology"}],"unit":null,"versions":[],"headline1":null,"entities":{"persons":["Gross","40"],"organizations":["HFCE","Market Services","GNI","Wales","Greater London Authority","NISRA","European Commission","Inter - Administration Committee","DESC","ERDF","Gross National Income","UK National Accounts","Devolved Economic Statistics Co -","UK GVA","ONS","UK","Economic Index","SIC Section L","National Statistics","ESF","West Wales","NUTS","European Social Fund","Methodology Information","National Accounts Blue Book","Local Authorities","QMI","SNAP","Statistics","Economic Accounts Project","EU","Value Added Tax","GVA","Economic","Local Enterprise Partnership","European Union","LEP","Welsh Government","GLA","Standard Industrial Classification","GDHI","Research Agency","European Regional Development Fund"],"dates":["December 2015","December 2017","December 2016","2014 to 2020","September 2017","2010","last year","summer","spring","end of March 2017","1998","2009","1997","2007","May 2016","2009 to 2015","late 2008 and 2009","April 2010","2020","SIC","march","1546","2018","2017","2016","first quarter of 2017","march 2016","2015","2014","2013","end of July 2017","Friday 16","January 2015","January 2017"],"locations":["Camden","South East","Europe","England","North Eastern Scotland","Scotland","Northern Ireland","Birmingham","Belfast","Waltham Forest","London","Manchester","Durham","Islands","Redbridge","Richmond"]},"headline2":null,"headline3":null,"relatedData":[{"uri":"/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/datasets/regionalgrossvalueaddedincomeapproach"},{"uri":"/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/datasets/regionalgrossvalueaddedexplorabledatasets"}],"relatedMethodology":[],"preUnit":null},"matched_queries":["logged_featureset"]},{"fields":{"_ltrlog":[{"log_entry":[{"name":"1","value":0.0},{"name":"2","value":3.7254822},{"name":"3","value":3.7813864}]}]},"_index":"bulletin","_type":"document","_id":"AWAmeQP7kn1BPMj_zq0D","_score":0.0,"_source":{"description":{"summary":"The value of ordinary shares held in UK incorporated companies listed on the London Stock Exchange by sector of the owner, with a county breakdown for shares owned outside the UK.","keywords":["beneficial ownership","national accounts","economy","personal investments"],"releaseDate":"2012-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","edition":"2010","language":"English","source":"","title":"Ownership of UK Quoted Shares","metaDescription":"Estimates of ordinary shares holdings in UK listed companies as at 31 December, provided in terms of National Accounts classifications.","nationalStatistic":true,"unit":"","headline1":"At the end of 2010 the UK stock market was valued at £1,777.5 billion","headline2":"Rest of the world investors owned 41.2 per cent of the value of the UK stock market at the end of 2010, up from 30.7 per cent in 1998","contact":{"name":"Harry Duff","telephone":"+44 (0)1633 456771","email":"share.ownership@ons.gsi.gov.uk"},"headline3":"Other financial institutions held 16.0 per cent of the value of the UK stock market at 31 December 2010, up from 2.7 per cent in 1998","preUnit":""},"edition":null,"source":null,"type":"bulletin","metaDescription":null,"contact":null,"relatedDocuments":[],"links":[],"accordion":[{"markdown":"1. **Whats New**\n\n\t**Multiple ownership pooled nominee account assumptions**\n\n\tIn 2011, the Government Statistical Service (GSS) Methodology Advisory Service conducted a methodological review. The recommendations are summarised in the [Share ownership methodology review](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/economy/share-ownership/index.html \"Share Ownership Quality\"). One recommendation was to update the sector assumptions for multiple ownership pooled nominee accounts.\n\n\tThis involved analysing company share registers, for which ONS employed a specialist company. The company chosen, Equiniti, had 42 of the FTSE 100 businesses as Equiniti Registrar clients. This meant a large proportion of total pooled nominee holdings by market value could be analysed. Based on the 42 UK companies within the FTSE100, Equiniti provided analysis of pooled nominee shareholdings representing £288.5 billion.\n\n\tThese new sector percentages have been incorporated in the estimates for 2010 share ownership. These changes make comparisons between years difficult.  \n\n2. **Code of Practice for Official Statistics**\n\n\tNational Statistics are produced to high professional standards set out in the [Code of Practice for Official Statistics](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/the-national-statistics-standard/code-of-practice/index.html \"Code of Practise - G&M\"). They undergo regular quality assurance reviews to ensure that they meet customer needs. They are produced free from any political interference.\n\n3. **Understanding the data**\n\n\t**Interpreting the data** \n\n\tThis statistical bulletin, produced by the Office for National Statistics every two years, shows the ownership of ordinary shares in quoted companies in the UK at 31 December 2010.\n\n\tShare ownership is measured using data from Euroclear (CREST), the electronic settlement system for equity share trading, and further analysis of share registers. Tables 1, 3, 6, 7 and 10 accompanying this statistical bulletin, show the market value of UK quoted shares by beneficial owner, with multiple ownership and excluded shares in paper form shown separately.\n\n\tIn order to identify the true beneficiary of multiple ownership pooled accounts, a sample of these accounts from company share registers were analysed. Assumptions for pooled and excluded shareholdings are further described in the methods section of the background notes. Tables 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, A and B show sector of beneficial owner after the multiple ownership pooled nominee accounts and excluded shares in paper form have been allocated to a category of beneficial owner. \n\n\tThe assumptions used to allocate pooled nominee accounts and excluded share in paper form were updated for 2010 share ownership, the first time since 1997. There are some significant changes which makes comparisons between the intermediate years difficult.\n\n\tThe register analyses were run as at 31 December 2010 but, due to the settlement period on the Euroclear (CREST) system, transactions immediately prior to 31 December may not have been recorded on the registers.\n\n\tIn 1998 the survey switched to using data from the Euroclear (CREST) system which led to discontinuities.  The largest impact was that some companies previously classified to unit trusts and investment trusts are now classified as other financial institutions.  This makes long-term trends in these sectors hard to identify.\n\n\tNote that the share ownership analysis has not been carried out at uniform intervals and care should be taken when interpreting figures 3 to 7 and tables A and B.\n\n\t**Definitions and explanations** \n\n\t- **Beneficial Owner**:  The true underlying owner of the share who receives the benefits of holding the share, for example income through dividends\n\n\t- **Market Capitalisation**: Total value of a listed company’s shares in issue, calculated as the number of shares multiplied by share price\n\n\t- **Dematerialisation**: Shares are held in electronic form, rather than in paper form\n\n\t- **Excluded shares**:  These are shareholdings not held on the electronic share register but held instead in paper form, such as some share holdings of company directors\n\n\t- **Multiple ownership pooled nominee accounts**:  One entry on the share register representing many beneficial owners from at least two different sectors.  Therefore the electronic share register cannot give the complete breakdown of beneficial ownership sector\n\n\t- **FSTE 100**: The FTSE 100 index is the most widely used UK stock market indicator representing around 80 per cent of the market capitalisation of the London Stock Exchange. The index has a base level of 1000 on 3 January 1984\n\n\t- **Buyback**: The repurchase of shares by the issuing company in order to reduce the number of shares on the market\n\n\t- **American Depositary Receipt (ADR) programme**:  An ADR is a negotiable certificate denominated in U.S. Dollars issued by a U.S. bank representing a specified number of shares in a foreign stock traded on a U.S. exchange or Over-The-Counter (OTC) market\n\n\t**Use of the data**\n\n\tThe principle purpose of these share ownership estimates are to populate within the UK National Accounts financial account, the assets side for a particular financial instrument, quoted UK shares.\n\n4. **Methods**\n\n\t**Sampling methodology**\n\n\tA sample of companies is taken from a database supplied by the London Stock Exchange.  All large companies in terms of market capitalisation are selected. The remaining companies within the sample are drawn with their probability of selection proportional to their market capitalisation. For 2010, all companies with a market capitalisation greater than £2.8 billion were selected. The remaining companies within the sample were drawn with probability of selection proportional to size (market capitalisation). For 2010, 200 companies were selected, representing 88 per cent of UK market capitalisation, which comprised:\n\n\t- the 83 largest companies by market capitalisation as at 30 September 2010\n\n\t- 117 smaller companies\n\n\tFor these sampled companies, the beneficial owners are obtained. Since 1998, data are acquired from Euroclear (CREST), the electronic settlement system for equity share trading, to estimate the value of UK quoted shares across sectors of beneficial owner on 31 December 2010.\n\n\tFor large companies, the value of shareholdings in each company is added together. For the smaller companies, the percentage split by sector is calculated for each company and the average of these percentage splits is applied to the total value of shares accounted for by all smaller companies. The overall aggregate figures are the sum of holdings in the large and smaller companies.\n\n\tA number of shares are still held in certificated form outside the Euroclear (CREST) system and have been classified to ‘excluded’ in the analysis.  For these and for multiple ownership pooled accounts holdings further allocation is required.\n\n\t**Multiple ownership and excluded shares** \n\n\tThe Euroclear (CREST) data for each sampled company are checked against the Waterlow Stock Exchange Yearbook 2010 published by Caritas Data which lists shareholders owning substantial numbers of ordinary shares. \n\n\tHoldings which remained unallocated after the checking and adjustment process are apportioned according to the following fixed percentages, which were based on additional analysis of the sample of companies.\n\n\t<ons-table path=\"/economy/investmentspensionsandtrusts/bulletins/ownershipofukquotedshares/2012-02-28/fc167ae9\" />\n\n\t<ons-table path=\"/economy/investmentspensionsandtrusts/bulletins/ownershipofukquotedshares/2012-02-28/851fbddc\" />\n\n\t**Analysis of pooled nominee accounts, 2010** \n\n\tONS would like to thank Equiniti for their analysis from which the percentages for allocating beneficial owner within pooled nominee accounts have been derived.\n\n\t**Categories of beneficial owner** \n\n\tAccounts should be classified according to the category of beneficial owner of the securities.  This information is used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in compiling data for use in the UK National Accounts.  Institutions or individuals that are not resident in the UK are classified to one of the two ‘overseas’ categories.  For the purposes of this coding only, residents in Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are classed as ‘overseas’.\n\n\tPooled nominee accounts where the beneficial owners all fall into one of the categories listed below should be classified to that category.  Otherwise, they should be classified to ‘multiple ownership: pooled nominees’\n\n\tChanges since Share Ownership 2008 statistical bulletin are clearly indicated in bold\n\n\t- Individuals: Includes holdings owned by individual persons resident in the UK (whether registered in their own name, through a PEP/ISA, or as clients of a stockbroker or fund management group); shares held for employee share ownership schemes; and shares held in trusts with named individual beneficiaries\n\n\t- Charities, churches etc.: Includes all private non-profit making bodies, including private trusts set up for charitable purposes, charities and holdings by universities and the church commissioners\n\n\t- Insurance companies: These are active in both life insurance and non-life (general) insurance\n\n\t- Pension funds: This includes local authority, public corporation and private pension funds. **Pooled pension funds managed by insurance companies are now classified here rather than insurance companies**\n\n\t- Investment trusts: Comprises authorised investment trusts and authorised closed-ended investment companies incorporated in the UK, including PEP/ISAs run by them\n\n\t- Unit trusts: Comprises authorised unit trusts, including PEP/ISAs run by unit trusts. **Open-ended investment companies (OEICs) are now included in this category, rather than investment trusts as both unit trusts and OEICs are open ended funds**\n\n\t- Banks: Comprises institutions authorised as deposit takers by the Bank of England\n\n\t- **Other financial institutions: This includes market participating holdings such as clearing accounts, market makers, stock lending and collateral accounts. This also includes funds such as index funds, exchange traded funds, hedge funds, socially responsible and ethical funds**\n\n\t- Non-financial companies: Includes private limited companies (Ltd’s), public limited companies (PLC’s) and unincorporated partnerships, such as firms of accountants and solicitors. Corporations owned by central government or local authorities should be classified to public corporations\n\n\t- Central Government: Includes government departments, government agencies and the Bank of England (including its issue department and banking department)\n\n\t- Local Government: Includes holdings held directly by local authorities.  Securities owned by local authority superannuation funds should be classified to pension funds\n\n\t- Public Corporations: Comprises corporations which, although owned by central government or local authorities, have substantial freedom to conduct their affairs on ordinary business lines. Securities owned by public corporation superannuation funds should be classified to pension funds\n\n\t- Non-resident: owner in EU: All institutions or individuals resident in countries of the European Union other than the UK\n\n\t- Non-resident: owner outside EU: All institutions or individuals resident in countries outside of the European Union. Also includes beneficial owners who are known to be resident abroad, but where the country of residence is not known precisely, and pooled nominee accounts where the beneficial owners are all non-residents but the split between EU and non-EU residents is not known\n\n5. **Quality**\n\n\tThe [Summary Quality Report](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/quality-information/index.html \"Quality and Methodology Information\") for Share Ownership will be made available in due course on the ONS website.\n\n\t**Revisions**\n\n\tThere are no revisions to previously published estimates.\n\n\tThe assumptions for multiple ownership pooled accounts have been updated for 2010. These assumptions were unchanged between 1998 and 2008. Without undertaking the analysis for every year, which would be labour intensive, it is not possible to identify whether changes happened in particular years or happened gradually.\n\n6. **Relevant links**\n\n\t- [MQ5: Investment by Insurance Companies, Pension Funds and Trusts](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/fi/mq5--investment-by-insurance-companies--pension-funds-and-trusts/3rd-quarter-2011.html \"MQ5: Investment by Insurance Companies, Pension Funds and Trusts: 3rd quarter 2011\")\n\n\t- [Public Sector interventions in the Financial Crisis (2.71 Mb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/psa/financial-crisis-and-statitical-classification/public-sector-interventions-in-the-financial-crisis/public-sector-interventions-in-the-financial-crisis-.pdf \"\")\n\n\t- London Stock Exchange \n\n\t- [Euroclear](https://www.euroclear.com/site/public/EUI \"Euroclear\")\n\n7. **Publication policy**\n\n\tDetails of the policy governing the release of new data are available from the [Media Relations Office][1].\n\n8. **Accessing data** \n\n\tThe complete run of data in the tables of this statistical bulletin is available to view and download in electronic format through [ONS Time Series Data](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pnfc1/share-ownership---share-register-survey-report/2010/dst-share-ownership-2010.html \"DST Share ownership 2010\").

Between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010 the value of all UK ordinary shares quoted on the London Stock Exchange increased by £619.7 billion to £1777.5 billion, an increase in value of 53.4 per cent.\n\nSince the 1980s, UK stock market indicators have generally risen over time. However from 1995 they show much sharper movements reflecting global events. Figure 2 shows the FTSE 100 index, the most widely used UK stock market indicator, from 1983 to 2010. The first sharp rise in the FTSE 100 between 1996 and 1999 was during the ‘dot-com bubble’. When the speculative bubble burst the FTSE 100 index fell over the period 2000 to 2003 by around 50 per cent. After this event, the UK stock market increased until the financial crisis began in late 2007. Subsequently, the FTSE 100 index fell by around 40 per cent before recovering again. The two events of the dot-com bubble and the financial crisis have also meant that the FTSE indices have shown less of an upward trend since 1995.   \n\n<ons-chart path=\"/economy/investmentspensionsandtrusts/bulletins/ownershipofukquotedshares/2012-02-28/111e2e5e\" />\n","title":"UK stock market"},{"markdown":"The registered owners of shares, whose names appear on the share register and on CREST, are not necessarily the same as the beneficial owners who ultimately own the shares and receive the dividends.  In particular, since dematerialisation of shares in 1996 there has been a growing trend towards investors using pooled nominee accounts.\n\nAt the end of 2010, 44.9 per cent of the total value of UK shares was held by multiple ownership pooled nominees and a further 16.2 per cent held in paper form.  In order to identify the true beneficiary, further analysis was conducted on a sample of accounts with percentage splits for sector ownership derived accordingly. The estimates for 2010 incorporate these new assumptions about the members of multiple ownership pooled nominee accounts. These changes make comparison between years difficult. See methods section of the Background Notes.\n\nThe percentage of pension funds ownership within the pooled nominee accounts is significantly lower than was assumed for the 1998 results onwards (7.7 per cent for 2010 compared with 50 per cent for 1998). One contributing factor may be pension funds attempting to address their funding shortfalls by moving away from a reliance on returns generated from investment in equities to lower risk strategies. Alternatively, UK pension funds may be investing in overseas equities rather than UK shares. \n","title":"Multiple ownership"},{"markdown":"The proportion of UK quoted shares (in terms of value) owned by rest of the world investors has increased substantially since 1963 (See Figure 3 and Table A). By 1998 holdings had increased to 30.7 per cent. The 21st century continued to see increases, with holdings highest in 2008 at 41.5 per cent.  The large increase since 1994 partly reflects the growth in international mergers and acquisitions, and the ease of overseas residents to invest in UK shares. Since 2006 the holdings have levelled out at around 40 per cent.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/economy/investmentspensionsandtrusts/bulletins/ownershipofukquotedshares/2012-02-28/968b12c2\" />\n","title":"Rest of the world holdings of UK shares"},{"markdown":"The proportion of shares held by individuals (Figure 4 and Table A) has declined since 1963 when individuals owned 54.0 per cent of UK quoted shares in terms of total value. Their percentage holdings reached a low of 10.2 per cent in 2008, however by 31 December 2010 this had risen to 11.5 per cent. This may reflect the relative strength of equities as an alternative investment compared with low interest rate returns on savings.\n\nIncluded in individual ownership are shares owned by company directors and those in privatised and demutualised building societies which are still owned by individuals.\n\nMany individuals also make investments in ordinary shares through unit trusts.  However, holdings via unit trusts that are not quoted companies are not included.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/economy/investmentspensionsandtrusts/bulletins/ownershipofukquotedshares/2012-02-28/72e4c555\" />\n","title":"UK individuals holdings of UK shares"},{"markdown":"The proportion of shares held by insurance companies (Figure 5 and Table A) grew from 10.0 per cent in 1963 to a high of 23.6 per cent in 1997.  Since this time, insurance companies’ holdings have continued to fall, reaching 8.6 per cent in 2010. This is the lowest recorded percentage of holdings by insurance companies since 1963. This fall could reflect insurance companies switching from UK equities to alternative investments. The ONS statistical bulletin [MQ5: Investment by Insurance Companies, Pension Funds and Trusts](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/fi/mq5--investment-by-insurance-companies--pension-funds-and-trusts/3rd-quarter-2011.html \"MQ5: Investment by Insurance Companies, Pension Funds and Trusts - 3rd quarter 2011\") shows that by the end of 2010, insurance companies investments in UK mutual funds had overtaken the value of their direct holdings.\n\nFor 2010, MQ5 reports investment in UK quoted shares by insurance companies at £217.5 billion, £63.9 billion higher than reported here. The differences could possibly be attributed to funds and other investment instruments run by insurance companies, which the 2010 share ownership categorises as other financial institutions. In addition, the analysis of share registers to identify true ownership of pooled nominee accounts classed pension funds run by insurance companies as pension funds, whereas on CREST any non-pooled holdings of this type would be categorised as insurance companies.   \n\n<ons-chart path=\"/economy/investmentspensionsandtrusts/bulletins/ownershipofukquotedshares/2012-02-28/3b5492c8\" />\n\n### Pension funds holdings of UK shares by value\n\nSince the high point of 1992, the proportion of shares held by pension funds (Figure 6 and Table A) has been falling. Fund managers have broadened their portfolios to seek higher returns and to spread risk.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2008, it was assumed that 50 per cent of the value of shares held by multiple ownership pooled nominee accounts would have underlying ownership by pension funds. This was based on analysis of share registers in 1997. For 2010 an exercise to update the sector allocations was completed. This analysis of pooled nominee accounts suggests that now only 7.8 per cent of their holdings are pension funds. This has had a large impact on the results given that over 40 per cent of the value of UK quoted shares is held in pooled accounts. Consequently, comparisons in the intermediate years between 1998 and 2010 should be made with caution.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/economy/investmentspensionsandtrusts/bulletins/ownershipofukquotedshares/2012-02-28/70cd75f0\" />\n","title":"UK insurance companies and pension funds holdings of UK shares"},{"markdown":"Other financial institutions held 16.0 per cent (£284.5 billion) of the value of UK quoted shares at 31 December 2010 (Figure 7 and Table A). This includes the holdings of many banking groups as the ultimate parent company is frequently not classified as a bank. Also included are new types of investment not elsewhere classified such as hedge funds.\n\nIn the 1990s these other financial institutions held a small percentage of UK quoted shares by value (2.7 per cent in 1998). This has continued to increase throughout the last decade. \nThe analysis of pooled nominee accounts identified several new types of investment vehicles which could have contributed to the rise since 2000. This could be attributed to the popularity of these as a way for individuals to invest in a diverse portfolio. However there could be a classification issue, where in some instances funds offered by insurance companies could be classed as other financial institutions or insurance companies.\n\nONS intends to discuss this possible classification issue with Euroclear, the primary data source provider, to ensure the beneficial categories continue to meet National Accounts requirements. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"/economy/investmentspensionsandtrusts/bulletins/ownershipofukquotedshares/2012-02-28/7ec962ab\" />\n\n### Government intervention in financial institutions\n\nThe financial crisis of 2008 led to unprecedented government intervention in the UK financial industry.\n\nThere was initial recapitalisation of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc (RBS) in November 2008 with a further injection in 2009. The recapitalisations of LloydsTSB Group plc and HBOS plc took place in 2009.  Government also participated in two subsequent recapitalisations of Lloyds Banking Group plc in 2009.  On 31 December 2010 these interventions equated to shareholdings valued at £53.6 billion.  For further information of the treatment of government interventions see the ONS article [Public Sector interventions in the Financial Crisis](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/psa/financial-crisis-and-statistical-classification/public-sector-interventions-in-the-financial-crisis/index.html \"Public Sector interventions in the Financial Crisis\").\n","title":"Other financial companies holdings of UK shares"},{"markdown":"The sample for 2010 share ownership included most companies in the FTSE 100 at 31 December 2010.  An analysis of holdings in these companies has been carried out, and grossed to cover all FTSE 100 companies. FTSE 100 companies comprised 81.7 per cent of the total value of the stock market at the end of 2010. \n\nFigure 8 and Table 9 shows, as a percentage, the value of funds invested by each beneficial holder split between the FTSE 100 and smaller companies at 31 December 2010. 69.1 per cent of individuals’ holdings by value were with FTSE100 companies with the remaining 30.9 per cent in other companies. The UK individuals’ holdings in other quoted companies was higher than average because this includes paper holdings by company directors. 84.6 per cent of the rest of the world shareholdings in UK quoted companies were with FTSE100 companies. Overseas investors were likely to be attracted to the biggest companies, many of which have an international presence. \nPrivate non-financial corporations (PNFCs) include shares held in treasury by some of the largest PNFCs where they buyback their own shares in order to subsequently either distribute to employees or cancel them. This is why 93.8 per cent of the shares held by PNFCs, in terms of value were within the FTSE 100.\n\nOf public sector holdings nearly 100 per cent are with FTSE 100 companies. This is due to the government interventions in Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland group, the value of which dwarf any other central government, local government or public corporation share holdings.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/economy/investmentspensionsandtrusts/bulletins/ownershipofukquotedshares/2012-02-28/363de12e\" />\n\nEstimates of the shareholdings by industry of issuing company are provided in Table C.\n","title":"Shares held in FTSE100 companies"},{"markdown":"On the 31 December 2010 the value of all UK quoted ordinary shares was £1,777.5 billion.

Therefore for non-pooled accounts, country ownership has been assigned within the rest of world category based on information from previous share ownership surveys. For large excluded shareholdings in paper form this information is obtained from company websites.\n\nMany of the rest of the world holdings are held in pooled accounts, and these holdings were identified through analysis of pooled accounts for a sample of share registers.

Therefore it is difficult to make comparisons with earlier years.\n\nEuropean holdings of UK shares at 31 December 2010 stood at 28 per cent.

Many of these shares (59% in 2014) are held in pooled nominee accounts with multiple ownership, or in the form of paper shares not on CREST. Some of the reference tables accompanying this bulletin show these shares separately; see the notes of these tables for details.\n\n\tIn order to identify the true beneficiary of multiple ownership pooled accounts, a sample of these accounts from company share registers were analysed. The analysis is further described in the methods section of the background notes. Paper shares are also assigned to a category of beneficial owner. All the tables and charts in this bulletin, and the remainder of the reference tables, are on this basis.\n\n\tCare should be taken when making comparisons between years. In 1998 the survey switched to using data from the Euroclear (CREST) system which led to discontinuities.  The largest impact was that some companies previously classified to unit trusts and investment trusts were from that point onwards classified as other financial institutions.  This makes long-term trends in these sectors harder to identify. Note also that the analysis of pooled nominee accounts was not updated between 1998 and 2008. For each of these years the 1997 analysis was used to compile the results. The impact of this is discussed in the relevant sections of this bulletin.\n\n\tNote that the share ownership analysis has not been carried out at uniform intervals and care should be taken when interpreting time series charts and tables in this publication.\n\n\t**Uses of the data** \n\n\tThe main purpose of the share ownership estimates is to populate the financial accounts. The data are used to derive the asset breakdown for the transaction line \"Quoted Shares\" in the financial accounts and, in the absence of any other information, the transaction line \"Unquoted Shares\".\n\n\tThe main use of the data externally is to provide definitive or benchmark data on the ownership of shares in UK companies. Individual companies need to know who owns their shares but there is also an interest in ownership more widely and the implications for policy in, for example, growing overseas ownership or declining ownership by individuals. Our data provides this benchmark every 2 years.\n\n\tWe regularly engage with users to gain feedback on the data. A Share Ownership User Group was set up in 2012 to take key users and stakeholders through the methodology used to produce the results. We have also regularly consulted with users on a bilateral basis.\n\n\tExternal users' main concerns with the data reflect the extent to which the published data differ from the industry view or outside analysis. Some users had commented that individuals owned a larger share of Alternative Investment Market (AIM) companies than those on the main market. AIM is the London Stock Exchange’s global market for smaller and growing companies.\n\n\tWith this in mind, the sample design was altered to increase the number of AIM companies selected. Table 4 shows beneficial ownership of FTSE 100, AIM companies and other listed companies.\n\n\t<ons-table path=\"/economy/investmentspensionsandtrusts/bulletins/ownershipofukquotedshares/2015-09-02/1f28c9f4\" />\n\n\t\n\tThese figures use the full sample of companies surveyed by Equiniti and Orient Capital to allocate pooled nominee accounts to beneficial owners, as the sample size is too small to use subsamples for each of the 3 groups. Therefore these figures should be regarded as indicative. However, the evidence suggests AIM companies are indeed owned to a greater extent by individual shareholders. However, because this study is conducted by value and AIM companies represent a small proportion (by value) of quoted shares of UK domiciled companies, they do not substantially affect the final results. We will continue to liaise with users to ensure that any differences in view are fully explored and reconciled. \n\n\tDifferences in definition may be a factor in explaining this difference in view. One such difference is the difference between the \tbeneficial owner and the registered owner; another is that the scope of the UK Economic Accounts (and hence this survey) only includes companies domiciled in the UK. The size of the sample could also be a factor.\n\n\tThere is also some concern over the extent to which the data are comparable over time. As noted elsewhere, the analysis of pooled nominee accounts conducted in 1997 was not updated until 2010. This means that there are issues of comparability with the data for 1998 to 2008. This is made clear in the presentation of Figures 3 to 8 in the main part of the bulletin. The results for 2010, 2012 and 2014 are considered to be broadly comparable.\n\n\t**Definitions and explanations** \n\n\t**American Depositary Receipt (ADR) programme**:  An ADR is a negotiable certificate denominated in U.S. Dollars issued by a U.S. bank representing a specified number of shares in a foreign stock traded on a U.S. exchange or Over-The-Counter (OTC) market.\n\n\t**Beneficial Owner**:  The true underlying owner of the share who receives the benefits of holding the share, for example income through dividends.\n\n\t**Buyback**: The repurchase of shares by the issuing company in order to reduce the number of shares on the market.\n\n\t**Dematerialisation**: Shares that are dematerialised are held in electronic form, rather than in paper form.\n\n\t**Excluded shares**:  These are shareholdings not held on the electronic share register but held instead in paper form, such as some share holdings of company directors.\n\n\t**FTSE 100**: The FTSE 100 index is the most widely used UK stock market indicator. It tracks the performance of the top 100 companies, representing around 80% of the total market capitalisation of the London Stock Exchange. The index has a base level of 1000 on 3 January 1984.\n\n\t**Held in treasury**: The portion of shares that a company keeps in their own treasury. Treasury stock may have come from a repurchase or buyback from shareholders or it may never have been issued in the first place.\n\n\t**Market Capitalisation**: Total value of a listed company’s shares in issue, calculated as the number of shares multiplied by share price.\n\n\t**Multiple ownership pooled nominee accounts**:  One entry on the share register representing many beneficial owners from at least 2 different sectors.  Therefore the electronic share register cannot give the complete breakdown of beneficial ownership sector: this must be established by means of a Companies Act 2006 Section 793 request.\n\n\t**Ordinary shares**: An ordinary share gives the right to its owner to share the profits of the company (dividends) and to vote at general meetings of the company. They are the most common form of shares in the UK.\n\n\t**Quoted shares**: Shares that are quoted on the London Stock Exchange. A quoted company is a company whose shares are quoted in this way.\n\n2. **Methods**\n\n\t**Sampling methodology**\n\n\tFor each Share Ownership Survey, a sample of companies is taken from a database obtained from the London Stock Exchange.  The typical sample size is around 200, with the top 80 to 90 largest companies in terms of market capitalisation automatically selected and the remaining companies drawn with their probability of selection proportional to their capitalisation. This set up ensures a large coverage in terms of market capitalisation and reduces the need for a larger sample, which would add to the cost of carrying out the survey.\n\n\tIn 2014, the results are based on 198 companies, representing approximately 85% of the total value of UK listed shares (as set out in the UK Economic Accounts). The sample comprised the 88 largest companies and 110 smaller listed companies.\n\n\tIn a change to previous years, 30 of the 110 smaller companies were selected from the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). This was in response to user feedback that AIM companies had different patterns of ownership to main market companies. This is discussed in Section 2 of these notes.\n\n\tFor the sampled companies, the beneficial owners are obtained. Since 1998 data are acquired from Euroclear (CREST), the electronic settlement system for equity share trading. Each registered participant in CREST has to specify to which National Accounts category the beneficial holder of the shares belongs. This information is used to estimate the value of UK quoted shares by sector of beneficial owner on a particular date.\n\n\tThis list gives these sector categories, in line with the [UK National Accounts][1]:\n\n\tIndividuals\n\n\tCharities, churches etc \n\n\tInsurance companies\n\n\tPension funds\n\n\tInvestment trusts\n\n\tUnit trusts \n\n\tBanks  \n\n\tOther financial institutions \n\n\tNon-financial companies\n\n\tCentral Government\n\n\tLocal Government\n\n\tPublic Corporations\n\n\tNon-resident: owner in EU\n\n\tNon-resident: owner outside EU\n\n\tMultiple ownership: pooled nominees\n\n\tAnnex B provides more detail on the composition of each of the categories. The multiple ownership category covers all those accounts where the beneficial owners are from 2 or more of the categories listed above, and are referred to as pooled nominee accounts.\n\n\tAdditionally, there are excluded shares not held on CREST. These are shareholdings in material form, such as some shareholdings of company directors. This value is calculated as the difference between the total shares in issue on the London Stock Exchange and those held on CREST. A range of sources are used to identify any major shareholdings which are then assigned to the correct beneficial ownership sector.\n\n\tThe remaining excluded shares are allocated to 2 sectors – individuals (87.3% in 2014) and the rest of the world (12.7% in 2014). These percentages are based on analysis by Equiniti and Orient Capital.\n\n\t**Work on multiple ownership for the 2014 results**  \n\n\tThe work undertaken for the 2014 Share Ownership Survey followed the same basic methodology as the 2012 survey. This was explained in a note, [Share Ownership Methodology][2], published in July 2013.\n\n\tWe continued our relationship with Equiniti and Orient Capital, who provided the analysis of multiple and single nominee accounts. We would like to thank Equiniti and Orient Capital for their work on the 2014 results.\n\n3. **Quality**\n\n\tThe [Quality and Methodology Information Report][3] for Share Ownership is available on our website.\n\n\tThe quality of the share ownership results for 2014 is likely to be high. The sample is representative and covers a large proportion of shares in scope. The survey has benefited from the continuing input by Equiniti and Orient Capital, who are recognised experts in the field. \n\n\t**Sampling error** \n\n\tSampling errors will arise when estimates are based on a sample rather than the whole population. In 2014, the Share Ownership Survey collected data from a sample of 198 companies, representing approximately 85% of total market capitalisation. The sample comprised the 88 largest companies and 110 smaller companies. Errors in the estimates will arise to the extent that the 110 small companies were unrepresentative of smaller companies in total, for example in the proportion of beneficial owners classified to the insurance sector.\n\n\t**Non-sampling error**\n\n\tNon-sampling error can arise due to errors in measurement and process. The primary data source for the Share Ownership Survey is CREST. Each registered participant in CREST has to specify, when setting up their account, to which National Accounts category the beneficial owners of the shares belongs. This information drives the allocation of the results and it is important that it is accurate and regularly maintained: We have previously worked with Euroclear to emphasise the importance of the sector allocation on CREST to clients and asking them to review their member account categorisation. \n\n\tNon-sampling errors may also arise in the analysis of share registers. Identifying the true beneficial owners is a specialised undertaking and in recent years this task has been carried out by Equiniti (2010) and Equiniti and Orient Capital (2012 and 2014).\n\n\t**Revisions** \n\n\tThere are some revisions to the previously published estimates for 2012. These are described in the main part of the bulletin.\n\n4. **Relevant links** \n\n\t[MQ5: Investment by Insurance Companies, Pension Funds and Trusts][4] \n\n\t[Public Sector interventions in the Financial Crisis][5] \n\n\t[London Stock Exchange][6] \n\n\t[Euroclear][7] \n\n5. **Following ONS** \n\n\tFollow us on [Twitter][8] and [Facebook][9].\n\n6. **Publication policy** \n\n\tDetails of the policy governing the release of new data are available by visiting [www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/code-of-practice/index.html][10] or from the Media Relations Office email: <media.relations@ons.gsi.gov.uk>\n\n7. **Accessing data** \n\n\tThe complete run of data in the tables of this statistical bulletin is available to view and download in electronic format through ONS Time Series Data.

This use essentially defines the concept of beneficial ownership – the beneficial owner is the person or organisation who benefits from the dividends or increases in the share price.\n\n\tThe beneficial owner is not necessarily the person or organisation managing the shares or the registered owner whose name appears on the share register and on CREST. In particular, since the dematerialisation of shares in 1996 there has been a growing trend towards investors using pooled nominee accounts: at the end of 2014, 58.4% of the total value of UK shares was held by multiple ownership pooled nominees, or those where the beneficial owner was not known. In these cases, in order to identify the true beneficiary, further analysis needs to be conducted on the accounts.\n\n\tThe difficulties in identifying the beneficial owner can lead to differences between different outputs even where they are trying to measure the same thing (this is over and above any differences that might result from factors such as differing sample sizes). There are a number of holdings which are difficult to analyse conclusively and judgements sometimes need to be made based on the information available. This is why it is important to use the services of a specialist company in this area.\n\n\tOther outputs can sometimes be measuring something different, such as economic exposure or interest. The ONS statistical bulletin MQ5: Investment by Insurance Companies, Pension Funds and Trusts  also reports investment in UK quoted shares by insurance companies. The numbers can sometimes differ significantly from the figures reported here. The difference could in part be attributed to funds and other investment instruments run by insurance companies, which the 2014 Share Ownership Survey categorises as other financial institutions. In addition, the analysis of share registers to identify the true ownership of pooled nominee accounts classifies pension funds run by insurance companies as pension funds.  \n\n\tThe analysis published in this Bulletin is a snapshot, taken at 31 December. At any one point in time shares might have been lent or sold but CREST may not have been updated in time for the snapshot; or CREST might have been updated where the change of ownership, although real, is only temporary. The following examples illustrate some of the difficulties in identifying or defining ownership:\n\n\t- if a bank holds shares as a depository for an insurance company, then they should still be classified to the insurance sector as ownership will not have changed\n\n\t- shares are regularly lent between sectors. In principle, these should be recorded under the sector borrowing the shares as ownership has changed. In practice, some depositaries disclose lent shares and it may not be possible to identify which shares have been lent. There is the further issue that if shares on loan are recorded as with the new owner, shares that move in the other direction should be treated in the same way; however, there may be an interest in recording the gross position, representing economic exposure or interest rather than ownership\n\n\t- if the insurance sector puts up shares for collateral for a financial transaction it may not be clear who owns the shares. An example is where an open derivative position is held and the shares are used as collateral. The shares may be reregistered and then classified as other financial institutions but the beneficial ownership remains with the party that has lodged the collateral.\n\n11. **Annex B**\n\n\tAccounts should be classified according to the category of beneficial owner of the securities. Institutions or individuals that are not resident in the UK are classified to one of the two ‘overseas’ categories.  For the purposes of this coding only, residents in Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are classed as ‘overseas’.\n\n\tPooled nominee accounts where the beneficial owners all fall into one of the categories listed below should be classified to that category. Otherwise, they should be classified to ‘multiple ownership: pooled nominees’.\n\n\tThe categories:\n\n\t- **Individuals**: Includes holdings owned by individual persons resident in the UK (whether registered in their own name, through an Individual Savings Account (ISA), Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) or tax-incentivised plan, or as customers of a stockbroker; shares held for employee share ownership schemes; and shares held in trusts with named individual beneficiaries\n\n\t- **Charities, churches etc.**: Includes all private non-profit making bodies, including private trusts set up for charitable purposes, charities and holdings by universities and the church commissioners.\n\n\t- **Insurance companies**: These are active in both life insurance and non-life (general) insurance.\n\n\t- **Pension funds**: This includes local authority, public corporation and private pension funds. Pooled pension funds managed by insurance companies are now classified here rather than insurance companies.\n\n\t- **Investment trusts**: Comprises authorised investment trusts and authorised closed-ended investment companies incorporated in the UK, including ISAs run by them.\n\n\t- **Unit trusts**: Comprises authorised unit trusts, including ISAs run by unit trusts. Open-ended investment companies (OEICs) are now included in this category, rather than investment trusts as both unit trust and OEICs are open ended funds.\n\n\t- **Banks**: Comprises institutions authorised as deposit takers by the Bank of England.\n\n\t- **Other financial institutions**: This includes market participating holdings such as clearing accounts, market makers, stock lending and collateral accounts. This also includes funds such as index funds, exchange traded funds, hedge funds, socially responsible and ethical funds.\n\n\t- **Non-financial companies**: Includes private limited companies (Ltd’s), public limited companies (PLC’s) and unincorporated partnerships, such as firms of accountants and solicitors. Corporations owned by central government or local authorities should be classified to public corporations.\n\n\t- **Central government**: Includes government departments, government agencies and the Bank of England (including its issue department and banking department). Part of the “public sector” category in the final results.\n\n\t- **Local government**: Includes holdings held directly by local authorities.  Securities owned by local authority superannuation funds should be classified to pension funds. Part of the “public sector” category in the final results.\n\n\t- **Public corporations**: Comprises corporations which, although owned by central government or local authorities, have substantial freedom to conduct their affairs on ordinary business lines. Securities owned by public corporation superannuation funds should be classified to pension funds. Part of the “public sector” category in the final results.\n\n\t- **Non-resident: owner in EU**: All institutions or individuals resident in countries of the European Union other than the UK. Part of the “rest of the world” category in the final results.\n\n\t- **Non-resident: owner outside EU**: All institutions or individuals resident in countries outside of the European Union.

It should be borne in mind that the FTSE 100 includes a number of companies that are domiciled overseas; these are excluded from the analysis in this bulletin. Some FTSE 100 companies are domiciled in the UK but conduct the majority of their business operations overseas; these companies are included in the analysis presented in this bulletin\n\nWith fluctuations, the trend of the FTSE 100 index is upwards until it peaked in 1999, during the ‘dot-com bubble’. When the speculative bubble burst the FTSE 100 index fell over the period 2000 to 2003 by around 50%. After this event, the UK stock market increased, peaking in late 2007. Subsequently, the FTSE 100 index fell by around 40% during the financial crisis, before recovering again.

In 2014, the sample of approximately 200 companies was selected to give coverage of a range of different types of company, including those listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). The results of the 2014 survey are considered to be comparable with those in 2010 and 2012, but these changes to the sample design and selection may have had a small impact.\n\nIn this publication, the total value of shares in quoted UK domiciled companies is consistent with the UK financial balance sheet ([Table 1.6.9 of the UK Economic Accounts][1]) published in June 2015. Since the publication of the 2012 share ownership results, the estimated total value of shares in UK quoted and domiciled companies at the end of 2012 has been revised down by £148 billion.  This has an impact on the grossing applied to the smaller companies in the 2012 sample, reducing the contribution they make to the overall results. The impact this has on the headline 2012 results is shown in Table 2.

For example, an individual overseas investor is classified to the “rest of the world” sector, rather than to individuals.\n\nThe proportion of UK domiciled companies’ quoted shares (in terms of value) owned by investors outside of the UK has increased substantially since 1963 (see Figure 3). By 1998, holdings had increased to 31%. This proportion continued to increase, and stood at 54% by the end of 2014, unchanged from the 2012 estimate. The large increases since 1994 reflect the increasing internationalisation of the London stock market and the increasing ease with which overseas residents can invest in UK-quoted shares (for example, through electronic trading). As a result, a substantial part of the ownership of rest of the world investors represents international investors owning international companies.\n\nNote that between 1998 and 2008, it was assumed that 20% of the value of shares held by multiple ownership pooled nominee accounts had underlying ownership by the rest of the world sector. This was based on analysis of share registers in 1997. A sampling exercise to update the sector allocations in 2010 showed that 58% of these holdings were owned by the rest of the world sector. This had a large impact on the results for 2010, given that over 40% of UK quoted shares were held in pooled accounts.

Their percentage holdings stood at 10% in 2012. In 2014, individual ownership increased to an estimated 12% of all shares in quoted UK domiciled companies. This long-term reduction in the proportion of shares owned by individuals in part reflects the increasing internationalisation of the London Stock Exchange over the period (individual overseas investors being classified to the “rest of the world” sector).\n\nNote that between 1998 and 2008, it was assumed that 1% of the value of shares held by multiple ownership pooled nominee accounts would have underlying ownership by individuals.

This had a large impact on the results for 2010, given that over 40% of UK quoted shares were held in pooled accounts. Consequently, comparisons in the intermediate years between 1997 and 2010 should be made with caution.\n\nIn 2014, the sample was redesigned to ensure more companies from the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) were included, with some users providing feedback that AIM companies were more likely to be owned by individuals. While this does appear to be the case, their impact on the 2014 results was limited by the size of AIM companies, and as such the majority of the increase came from an increase in ownership by individuals in the main market. See Section 2 of the background notes for more details.\n\nIncluded in individual ownership are shares owned by company directors. Many individuals also make investments in ordinary shares through unit trusts.

The numbers can sometimes differ significantly from the figures reported here. The difference can in part be attributed to funds and other investment instruments run by insurance companies, which the Share Ownership Survey categorises as other financial institutions.

The survey also estimated that there were 829,000 incidents of crime against children aged 10 to 15. \n\nThe decrease shown by the CSEW was largely driven by falls in theft offences (down 7%) and criminal damage (down 14%). \n\nThere was a 7% increase in police recorded crime compared with the previous year, with 4.4 million offences recorded in the year ending December 2015. Most of this rise is thought to be owing to improved crime recording by the police leading to a greater proportion of reports of crime being recorded in the last year. \n\nImprovements in recording of crime are thought to have particularly affected some categories of violent crime recorded by the police. There was a 27% rise in \"violence against the person\" offences (an additional 198,658 offences) which was largely driven by increases within the \"violence without injury\" subgroup (up by 143,239 offences; a 38% increase). The CSEW estimate for violent crime showed no statistically significant change compared with the previous year’s survey.\n\nThere were also increases in some of the lower volume but more serious types of police recorded violence, including an 11% rise in homicide (up 56 to 573 offences) and a 9% rise in offences involving knives or sharp instruments (up 2,425 to 28,008 offences). Regarding the latter, there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that a tightening of recording procedures may be contributing to the increase in some forces.\n\nThe police data also continued to show a rise in recorded sexual offences, with the latest figures up 29% on the previous year; equivalent to an additional 23,349 offences and bringing the total to over 100,000 in a single year for the first time (103,614). The numbers of rapes (34,741) and other sexual offences (68,873) were at the highest level recorded since the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in the year ending March 2003. As well as improvements in recording, these rises are also thought to reflect a greater willingness of victims to come forward to report such crimes.\n\nThere was a 4% increase in the volume of fraud offences referred to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) at the City of London Police. In total, 617,618 offences were referred to NFIB, including 224,683 offences reported by victims to Action Fraud (the UK’s national fraud reporting centre), 295,525 referrals from Cifas (a UK-wide fraud prevention service) and 97,411 cases from Financial Fraud Action UK (FFA UK; a body that represents the UK payments industry). It is known that many cases of fraud do not come to the attention of the police, and these figures provide a very partial picture. A more complete picture will be published next quarter when early estimates are available from new CSEW  data on fraud and cybercrime.\n","title":"Main points"},{"markdown":"The briefing note ‘[Improving Crime Statistics for England and Wales – progress update][1]’ provides details of our plans to improve the design, coverage and presentation of crime statistics in England and Wales over the next 3 years.\n\nAs part of this work, this quarterly bulletin has been produced in a new, shorter format, with the aim of making the main messages more accessible. \n\nThis is an initial step towards reducing the length of our quarterly statistical bulletin on crime and we intend to continue developing its structure in future editions as well as conducting an extensive review of the data tables published with each release. As part of this review we will be seeking users’ views on whether there is a continuing need for all of the data we publish and whether there are new needs for data we are not currently producing. We will also be looking at opportunities to exploit new data sources to meet user requirements for more detailed information on the nature of crime.\nWe would welcome any feedback on this new format or any aspect of our improvement programme at <crimestatistics@ons.gov.uk>.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/improvingcrimestatisticsforenglandandwalesprogressupdate","title":"Feedback on crime statistics outputs"},{"markdown":"This quarterly release presents the most recent crime statistics from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) and police recorded crime. Neither of these sources can provide a picture of total crime, and coverage is described in this section.\n\n- the latest CSEW figures included in this release are based on interviews conducted between January 2015 and December 2015, measuring experiences of crime in the 12 months before the interview\n- the police recorded crime figures presented relate to notifiable offences^1^ recorded by the police during the year ending December 2015^2^\n\nThere is a 9-month overlap of the data reported here with the data contained in the previous bulletin. Therefore, year-on-year comparisons are made with the previous year; that is, the 12-month period ending December 2014 (rather than those published last quarter).\n\n###Crime Survey for England and Wales\n\nThe CSEW is a face-to-face victimisation survey in which people resident in households in England and Wales are asked about their experiences of a selected number of offences in the 12 months prior to the interview. It covers adults aged 16 and over, and a separate survey is used to cover children aged 10 to 15, but neither cover those living in communal establishments (such as care homes, student halls of residence and prisons), or crimes against commercial or public sector bodies. For the population and offence types it covers, the CSEW provides robust estimates on a consistent basis over time.\n\nThe CSEW is able to capture a broad range of victim-based crimes experienced by those interviewed, not just those that have been reported to, and recorded by, the police. However, there are some serious but relatively low-volume offences, such as homicide and sexual offences, which are not included in its main estimates. The survey also currently excludes fraud and cyber crime – [ongoing development work][1] to address this particular gap is described in the ‘Data sources – coverage and coherence’ section. \n\n[An infographic looking at the people and crimes covered by the CSEW][2] was published in October 2014.\n\n###Police recorded crime\n\nPolice recorded crime figures are restricted to a subset of notifiable offences that have been reported to and recorded by the police, and so do not provide a total count of all crimes that take place. They are supplied by the 43 territorial police forces of England and Wales, plus the British Transport Police, via the Home Office.\n\nPolice recorded crime is the primary source for subnational crime statistics and for relatively serious, but low volume, crimes that are not well measured by a sample survey. It covers victims and sectors excluded from the CSEW sample (for example, residents of institutions and tourists, and crimes against commercial bodies). While the police recorded crime series covers a wider population and a broader^3^ set of offences than the CSEW, it does not include crimes that do not come to the attention of the police or are not recorded by them. As a result, police recorded crime figures will be lower than the estimates produced by the CSEW.\n\nThe series can also be split into 2 broad types of crime:\n\n- victim-based crimes – those that have a specific identifiable victim, either a household (for example, burglary), an individual (for example, violence against the person), or an organisation (for example, shoplifting)\n\n- other crimes against society – those that do not normally have a direct victim, such as drug offences, possession of weapon offences or miscellaneous crimes against society. Trends in such offences often reflect changes in police activity and workload rather than levels of criminality as, without a direct victim, recording of these offences is directly related to policing practices\n\n###Accuracy\n\nFollowing an [assessment of crime statistics][3] by the UK Statistics Authority, published in January 2014, the statistics based on police recorded crime data have been found not to meet the required standard for designation as National Statistics. Data from the CSEW continue to be designated as National Statistics.\n\nHer Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) undertook an inspection of the integrity of police recorded crime between December 2013 and August 2014 and concluded that, across England and Wales as a whole, an estimated 1 in 5 offences (19%) that should have been recorded as crimes were not. The renewed focus on the quality of crime recording following this audit means that caution is needed when interpreting trends in police recorded crime. Apparent increases in police recorded crime data may reflect a number of factors, including tightening of recording practice, increases in reporting by victims and also genuine increases in the levels of crime.\n\nFurther information is also available in the ‘Accuracy of the statistics’ section.\n\n###Useful links\n\nAn [interactive guide][4] provides a general overview of crime statistics. Further information on the datasets is available in the ‘Data sources – coverage and coherence’ section and the [CSEW technical report][5].\n\nThe [User Guide to Crime Statistics for England and Wales][6] provides information for those wanting to obtain more detail on crime statistics. This includes information on the datasets used to compile the statistics and is a useful reference guide for users.\n\nThe [quality and methodology report][7] sets out detailed information about the quality of crime statistics and the roles and responsibilities of the different departments involved in the production and publication of crime statistics. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###Notes:\n1. Notifiable offences refer to offences for which there is a legal requirement that the police inform the Home Office of their occurrence. These notifiable offences relate only to crimes that could possibly be tried by a jury and exclude less serious (non-notifiable) offences such as parking fines (usually dealt with in magistrates courts). Further detail is available in Chapter 3 of the User Guide.\n\n2. Police recorded crime statistics are based on the year in which the offence was recorded, rather than the year in which it was committed. Therefore, such data for any given period will include some historic offences that occurred in a previous year to the one in which they were reported to the police.\n\n3. The coverage of police recorded crime is defined by the Notifiable Offence List, which includes all indictable and triable-either-way-offences (offences which could be tried at a crown court) and a few additional closely related summary offences (which would be dealt with by magistrates’ courts). Appendix 1 of the [User Guide][8] has more information on the classifications used for notifiable crimes recorded by the police.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/crime-statistics-methodology/methodological-notes/methodological-note---csew-fraud-and-cyber-crime-development--field-trial---october-2015.pdf\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/crime-stats/crime-statistics/period-ending-june-2014/info-what-does-csew-cover.html\n  [3]: http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/assessment/assessment-reports/assessment-report-268---statistics-on-crime-in-england-and-wales.pdf\n  [4]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology\n  [5]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology\n  [6]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/crime-statistics-methodology/user-guides/user-guide-to-crime-statistics.pdf\n  [7]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/qmis/crimeandjusticeqmi\n  [8]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/crime-statistics-methodology/user-guides/user-guide-to-crime-statistics.pdf","title":"Understanding crime statistics"},{"markdown":"Latest figures from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) show there were an estimated 6.4 million incidents of crime against households and resident adults (aged 16 and over) in England and Wales for the year ending December 2015 (Table 1). This is a 7% decrease from the 6.9 million incidents estimated in the previous year’s survey and the latest estimate is the lowest since the survey began in 1981.The estimated number of CSEW incidents is around a third lower (31%) than the year ending March 2010 survey and around two-thirds lower (66%) than its peak level in 1995. \n\nThese figures relate to a broad range of victim-based crimes experienced by the resident household population. However, they exclude some serious (but low volume) offences such as homicide and sexual offences as well as fraud and cyber crime offences^1^ and crimes against children.\n\nCrime covered by the CSEW increased steadily from 1981, before peaking in 1995. After peaking, the CSEW showed marked falls until the year ending March 2005 survey year. Since then, the underlying trend has continued downwards, but with some fluctuation from year to year (Figure 1).\n\n<ons-image path=\"b1db7174\" />\n\nCSEW estimates of crimes experienced by children aged 10 to 15 are not directly comparable with the main survey of adults, so are not included in the headline total. In the year ending December 2015, the CSEW estimated that 829,000 crimes^2^ were experienced by children aged 10 to 15. Of this number, 48% were categorised as violent crimes^3^ (398,000), while most of the remainder were thefts of personal property (275,000; 33%). Given the small sample size for the 10- to 15-year old element of the CSEW, trends in these estimates can fluctuate, and as a result trends can be difficult to interpret. Detailed data are available from [Tables 24, 25 and 26][1].\n\nThe police recorded 4.4 million offences in the year ending December 2015, an increase of 7% compared with the previous year ([Appendix Table A4][2]). Of the 44 forces (including the British Transport Police), 39 showed an annual increase in total recorded crime, which was largely driven by rises in the volume of \"violence against the person\" offences. \n\nThis increase needs to be seen in the context of the renewed focus on the quality of crime recording by the police, undertaken in light of the inspections of forces by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), the [Public Administration Select Committee (PASC) inquiry][3] into crime statistics, and the [UK Statistics Authority’s decision][4] to remove the National Statistics designation from police recorded crime statistics. This renewed focus is thought to have led to improved compliance with the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS), leading to a greater proportion of crimes now coming to the attention of the police. \n\nLike CSEW crime estimates, police recorded crime also increased during most of the 1980s and then fell each year from 1992 to year ending March 1999. Expanded coverage of offences in the police recorded crime collection, following changes to the Home Office Counting Rules (HOCR) in 1998 and the introduction of the NCRS in April 2002, saw increases in the number of crimes recorded by the police while the CSEW count fell. Following these changes, trends from both series tracked each other well from year ending March 2003 until year ending March 2007. While both series continued to show a downward trend between year ending March 2008 and year ending March 2013^4^, the gap between them widened with police recorded crime showing a faster rate of reduction – a trend attributed to a gradual erosion of compliance with the NCRS (see the ‘Accuracy of the Statistics’ section for further information). From 2014 onwards, overall police recorded crime has increased, while CSEW estimates have continued to fall. \n\n###Other related sources  \n\nNeither the CSEW nor police recorded crime figures provide a total picture of crime. Other sources of information about crimes in England and Wales include administrative data on anti-social behaviour and non-notifiable offences, and the Commercial Victimisation Survey, which provides estimates of crime against business premises.\n\nAround 1.8 million incidents of anti-social behaviour (ASB) were recorded by the police for the year ending December 2015, a decrease of 8% compared with the previous year. These are incidents that may still be crimes in law, such as littering or dog fouling, but are not of a level of severity that would result in the recording of a notifiable offence and therefore are not included in the police recorded crime figures. A review by HMIC in 2012 found that there was a [wide variation in the quality of decision making associated with the recording of ASB][5]. As a result, ASB incident data should be interpreted with caution. The CSEW also provides some information on ASB – 28% of respondents reported experiencing or witnessing ASB in their local area in the year ending December 2015. This estimate has remained at a similar level since the data were first collected in the year ending March 2012. Further information is available in [Figures 16 and 17 and Tables 27 and 28][6].\n\nIn the year ending September 2015 (the latest period for which data are available) there were 1.05 million convictions for non-notifiable offences^5^ that were not covered in police recorded crime or the CSEW. This was an increase of 5% from the year ending September 2014 and continues a pattern of similar rises recorded from the year ending December 2014 onwards. Convictions for speeding offences and prosecutions for TV licence evasion were the main drivers of the increase. In addition, there were 23,000 Penalty Notices for Disorder issued in relation to non-notifiable offences for the year ending September 2015, a decrease of 24% from the previous year. Further information is available in [Tables 29a and 29b][7].\n\nThe CSEW does not cover crimes against businesses and police recorded crime can only provide a partial picture (as not all offences come to the attention of the police). The [Commercial Victimisation Survey][8] provides estimates of incidents of crime against business premises^6^ in England and Wales and gives some insight into the number of these crimes that go unreported to the police. However, it does not cover all sectors of industry and the small sample sizes associated with individual sectors means that caution must be applied when comparing crime rates over time. In 2014 (the latest data available^7^) businesses in the wholesale and retail sector experienced the highest estimated levels of crime – an estimated 4.1 million, a rate of around 13,000 crimes per 1,000 business premises ([Table 30][9]). Reporting rates for frauds, non-vehicle-related thefts, assaults and threats, and vandalism, were all estimated to be below 50%.\n\nThe previous report ‘[Crime in England and Wales: year ending September 2015][10]’ also contains further commentary on trends in these other sources.\n\n\n\n\n###Notes:\n1. The CSEW currently excludes fraud and cyber crime from its headline figures. [Development work to add new questions to the survey][11] to cover these areas has been undertaken and initial estimates will be available by summer 2016. \n2. The survey of children aged 10 to 15 only covers personal level crime (so excludes household level crime) and, as with the main survey, does not include sexual offences.\n3. The majority (76%) of violent crimes experienced in the year ending December 2015 resulted in minor or no injury, so in just over three-quarters of cases the violence is low level.\n4. From year ending March 2012 a step-change in the police recorded crime data series was created by the inclusion of additional sources of data on fraud. This masks the full scale of the reduction in police recorded crime that occurred towards the end of this period.\n5. Non-notifiable offences are offences dealt with exclusively by magistrates’ courts or by the police issuing of a Penalty Notice for Disorder or a Fixed Penalty Notice. Along with non-notifiable offences dealt with by the police (such as speeding), these include many offences that may be dealt with by other agencies – for example: prosecutions by TV Licensing; or the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) for vehicle registration offences.\n6. This is a premises based survey: respondents were asked if the business at their current premises had experienced any of a range of crime types in the 12 months prior to interview and, if so, how many incidents of crime had been experienced.\n7. Data from the 2015 Commercial Victimisation Survey is due to be published on 28 April 2016.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesbulletintables\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesappendixtables\n  [3]: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmpubadm/760/760.pdf\n  [4]: http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/assessment/assessment-reports/assessment-report-268---statistics-on-crime-in-england-and-wales.pdf\n  [5]: http://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmic/publication/a-step-in-the-right-direction-the-policing-of-anti-social-behaviour/\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesbulletintables\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesbulletintables\n  [8]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/crime-against-businesses-findings-from-the-2014-commercial-victimisation-survey\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesbulletintables\n  [10]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingseptember2015\n  [11]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/crime-statistics-methodology/methodological-notes/methodological-note---csew-fraud-and-cyber-crime-development--field-trial---october-2015.pdf","title":"Headline figures and trends"},{"markdown":"The CSEW provides coverage of a broad range of victim-based crimes^1^, although there are exclusions from its main estimates, such as homicide and sexual offences. Table 1 shows the latest figures and comparisons with earlier years for the main categories that contribute to the headline estimates from the survey: violence, robbery, theft offences and criminal damage. \n\n<ons-table path=\"f0e1448f\" />\n\nThe 7% decrease in the estimate of all CSEW crime for the year ending December 2015 compared with the previous year’s survey was largely driven by decreases in theft offences (down 7% to 3.8 million offences) and criminal damage (down 14% to 1.2 million offences). \n\nPolice recorded crime increased by 7% in the year ending December 2015 compared with the year ending December 2014. This was largely driven by increases in \"violence against the person\" offences (up 27% to 939,518 offences) along with increases in public order offences (up 28% to 193,310 offences), criminal damage and arson offences (up 6% to 531,693 offences), sexual offences (up 29% to 103,614 offences) and fraud (up 4% to 617,618 offences). While total theft offences have remained broadly similar, there have been increases in the subcategories of vehicle offences (up 3% to 364,468) and shoplifting (up 2% to 333,671) offset by decreases in burglary (down 4% to 401,718) and bicycle theft (down 7% to 87,895).\n\n<ons-table path=\"d1b7397e\" />\n\nVictim-based crime (including fraud), which covers offences with a specific identifiable victim, accounted for 90% of all police recorded crime. There were 4 million offences recorded in the year ending December 2015, an increase of 7% compared with the previous year. Excluding fraud, there were 3.4 million victim-based offences, equivalent to 59 recorded offences per 1,000 resident population in England and Wales ([Table 5][1]; this should not be read as a victimisation rate as multiple offences could be reported by the same victim). \n\nFigure 2 focuses on selected police recorded crime offences with notable changes in the year ending December 2015 compared with the previous year. \n\n<ons-image path=\"a8c6c84a\" />\n\n###Violent crime\n\nThere was a 27% increase in \"violence against the person\" offences recorded by the police in the year ending December 2015 compared with the previous year. Improvements in crime recording processes by the police are thought to be the main driver of this change. The \"violence without injury\" subcategory showed an increase of 38% over the same period, while the \"violence with injury\" subcategory showed a smaller increase (15%). It should be noted that the more serious offences involving injury are generally less likely to have been affected by the crime recording improvements. In the year ending December 2015, the police also recorded 573 homicides, 56 more than the previous year^2^.\n\nAdditionally, part of the rise in violence without injury can also be attributed to a large increase (77%, 57,578 offences) in harassment, which mainly resulted from the expansion of this category in April 2015 to include 2 additional offence categories that were previously non-notifiable.\n\nEstimates of violent crime from the CSEW have shown large falls since peak levels in the mid-1990s, but the latest year’s survey has shown little change compared with the previous year (the apparent 2% fall was not statistically significant).\n\nSee the ‘Violent crime’ section of this bulletin for more detailed analysis and commentary. Further data are available from [Tables 6a, 6b, 7a and 7b][2].\n\n###Sexual offences\nSexual offences recorded by the police increased by 29% compared with the previous year, to a total of 103,614 across England and Wales. This is the first time that the total has risen above 100,000 offences in a year. Within this, the number of offences of rape increased by 30% (up to 34,741) and other sexual offences by 29% (up to 68,873). These rises are among the largest year-on-year increases since the introduction of the NCRS in year ending March 2003. It is thought that rises in police recorded sexual offences are likely to be due to an improvement in recording by the police and an increase in the willingness of victims to come forward and report to the police.\n\nAlthough sexual offences are not included in the main CSEW estimates, it does provide some information on sexual offences from a self-completion questionnaire module on intimate violence. See the ‘Sexual offences’ section of this bulletin for more detailed analysis and commentary. Further data on police recorded sexual offences are available from [Tables 10a and 10b][3].\n\n###Offences involving weapons\n\nOffences involving firearms^3^ increased 4% (by 200 offences to 5,122) in the year ending December 2015 compared with the previous year. However, this was largely driven by an 18% increase in offences involving imitation and other weapons such as BB guns and soft air weapons; by contrast, offences involving handguns, shotguns and rifles decreased by 1%.\n\nThe number of offences that involved a knife or sharp instrument^4^ also showed an increase (9%) over the past 12 months. This contrasts with the general downward trend in this series over the longer-term, although the latest figures are 14% lower than in the year ending March 2011.\n\nSee the ‘Offences involving weapons’ section of this bulletin for more detailed analysis and commentary. Further data are available from [Tables 11a, 11b and 12][4].\n\n###Robbery\n\nPolice recorded robberies fell 2% in the year ending December 2015 compared with the previous year, to 50,772 offences. The CSEW interviews estimated that there were 124,000 robbery offences in the year ending December 2015. However, the small number of robbery victims interviewed in any single year means that CSEW estimates are prone to fluctuation and the apparent 18% increase in robberies was not statistically significant. \n\nSee [Tables 8a, 8b, 9a and 9b and Figure 8][5] for data related to this crime type.\n\n###Theft offences\n\nTheft offences recorded by the police (which includes burglary, theft from the person, vehicle-related theft, bicycle theft, shoplifting and \"all other theft offences\") were at similar levels to the previous year, with a small decrease of 7,627 offences (-0.4%). The longer-term trend has shown year-on-year decreases since the year ending March 2003. Within the overall figure there were decreases in bicycle theft (7%), burglary (4%) and \"all other theft offences\" (1%) offset by increases in vehicle offences (3%), theft from the person (2%) and shoplifting (2%). \n\nCSEW theft offences (which includes similar categories with the exception of shoplifting) fell by 7% in the year ending December 2015 compared with the previous year, to an estimated 3.8 million offences. This included an estimated 15% fall in bicycle theft (from 392,000 to 332,000).\n\nA range of additional data related to different types of theft offences is provided in [Tables 13 to 18 and Figures 9 to 13][6].\n\n###Fraud\n\nIn the year ending December 2015, the police recorded 617,618 fraud offences in England and Wales, an increase of 4% from the previous year. The police recorded crime series includes offences reported to Action Fraud (the national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre) as well as those reported to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) by 2 industry bodies: Cifas and Financial Fraud Action UK (FFA UK).\n \nFraud is an offence not currently included in the CSEW headline estimate. We are conducting work to extend the main victimisation module in the CSEW to cover elements of fraud and cybercrime. Initial findings from a recent field trial of newly developed survey questions can be found in the methodological note ‘[CSEW Fraud and Cyber-crime development: Field trial][7]’.\n\nSee the ‘Fraud’ section of this bulletin for more detailed analysis and commentary. Further data are available from [Tables 22a, 22b and 23][8].\n\n###Criminal damage\n\nThe police recorded 531,693 criminal damage and arson offences in the year to December 2015, an increase of 6% from the previous year. This is likely to be due to improvements in police crime recording for criminal damage offences.\n\nThe number of incidents of criminal damage estimated by the CSEW in the year ending December 2015 was 1.2 million, a decrease of 14% compared with the previous year, continuing the downward trend seen since the year ending March 2009 survey.\n\nSee [Tables 19a, 19b, 20a and 20b and Figure 14][9] for data related to this crime type.\n\n###Other crimes against society^5^ \n\nOther crimes against society (those crimes that do not have a specific identifiable victim) accounted for 10% of all police recorded crime, with 429,759 offences recorded in the year ending December 2015 (an increase of 7% compared with the previous year). Trends in such offences often reflect changes in police activity and workload, rather than levels of criminality (without a direct victim, recording of these offences is directly related to policing practices). Anecdotal evidence from forces also suggests that some increases in this grouping, such as those seen in public order offences, are being driven by a tightening of recording practices. Public order offences accounted for the largest volume rise within this offence category with an increase of 28% (up by 42,210). Miscellaneous crimes against society increased by 22% (up by 10,883), offences involving possession of weapons increased by 15% (up by 3,218), but drug offences decreased by 16% (down by 28,065).\n\nSee [Tables 21a and 21b and Figure 15][10] for data related to this crime type.\n\n\n\n\n\n###Notes:\n1. Victim-based crimes are those offences with a specific identifiable victim. These include the CSEW categories of violence, robbery, theft offences, and criminal damage and the police recorded crime categories of violence against the person, sexual offences, robbery, theft offences, and criminal damage and arson.\n2. Homicide includes the offences of murder, manslaughter, corporate manslaughter and infanticide. Figures from the Homicide Index for the time period April 2014 to March 2015, which take account of further police investigations and court outcomes, were published in [Focus on Violent Crime and Sexual Offences, year ending March 2015][11] on 11 February 2016.\n3. Firearms include shotguns; handguns; rifles; imitation weapons such as BB guns or soft air weapons; other weapons such as CS gas or pepper spray and stun guns; and unidentified weapons. It excludes conventional air weapons such as air rifles.\n4. Only selected violent offences can be broken down by whether a knife or sharp instrument was used. These are: homicide; attempted murder; threats to kill; assault with injury and assault with intent to cause serious harm; robbery; rape; and sexual assault.\n5. ‘Other crimes against society’ cover offences without a direct victim, and includes drug offences, possession of weapon offences, public order offences and miscellaneous crimes against society.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesbulletintables\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesbulletintables\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesbulletintables\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesbulletintables\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesbulletintables\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesbulletintables\n  [7]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/crime-statistics-methodology/methodological-notes/methodological-note---csew-fraud-and-cyber-crime-development--field-trial---october-2015.pdf\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesbulletintables\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesbulletintables\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesbulletintables\n  [11]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/crime-stats/crime-statistics/focus-on-violent-crime-and-sexual-offences--2014-to-2015/index.html","title":"Summary by crime type"},{"markdown":"Violent crime in the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) is referred to as “violence”, and includes wounding and assault (for both completed and attempted incidents). There is also an additional breakdown of violence with, or without, injury. Violent offences in police recorded data are referred to as “violence against the person” and include homicide, violence with injury, and violence without injury. As with the CSEW, both actual and attempted assaults are included in the figures. There are some closely related offences in the police recorded crime series, such as public order offences, that have no identifiable victim and are within the other crimes against society category. \n\n###CSEW Violence\n\nLatest CSEW estimates show there were 1.3 million violent incidents in England and Wales in the year ending December 2015; a similar level compared with last year’s survey (the apparent 2% fall was not statistically significant) (Figure 3).\n\n<ons-image path=\"d5458d50\" />\n\nThe CSEW subcategories of “violence with injury” and “violence without injury” also showed no significant change when compared with the previous year (the apparent 3% fall in violence without injury was not statistically significant). \n\nThe number of violent incidents estimated by the survey has decreased by around two-thirds since the peak in 1995 ([Table 6b][1]). Around 2 in every 100 adults were a victim of violent crime in the last year, based on the year ending December 2015 survey, compared with around 5 in 100 adults in the 1995 survey ([Table 6a][2]). Estimates of violence against 10 to 15 year olds, as measured by the CSEW, can be found in [Table 25][3].\n\nRecent trends in violent crime, as shown by the CSEW, are also reflected in evidence from research conducted by the Violence and Society Research Group at Cardiff University. Findings from their annual survey, covering a sample of hospital emergency departments and walk-in centres in England and Wales, show that serious violence-related attendances in 2015 were broadly similar to the level recorded in 2014 following a declining trend seen in earlier years. In addition, the most recent provisional National Health Service (NHS) data available on assault admissions to hospitals in England show that, for the 12 months to the end of April 2015, there were 28,992 hospital admissions for assault, a reduction of 8% compared with figures for the preceding 12 months^1^.\n\n###Police recorded crime – violence against the person\n\nThe number of \"violence against the person\" offences recorded by the police in the year ending December 2015 showed a 27% increase compared with the previous year (up from 740,860 to 939,518, [Tables 7a and 7b][5]). This includes much larger increases in the category of “violence without injury” (up 38%), compared with “violence with injury” (up 15%). \n\nThe increase in the “violence with injury” category includes a 31% rise in attempted murder, up 165 offences to 689 in the year ending December 2015. Attempted murder has risen in 31 of the 44 police forces in England and Wales. Although consistent with the increase in homicide over the same period, figures for attempted murder may have been influenced by improvements in crime recording. Prior to the recent tightening of recording practices it is possible that some police officers may have been applying Crown Prosecution Service charging standards (guidelines on what charges should be brought against suspects) when deciding what type of crime to record rather than basing the decision on the Home Office Counting Rules (HOCR). Attempted murder is an important example of this potential issue as offences may have previously been recorded (and charged) as another type of violent crime that is easier to prove in court, such as “wounding with intent”.\n\nThe increase in “violence without injury” is partially due to a 77% rise in harassment, up 57,578 offences in the year ending December 2015. The rise in harassment is largely due to the inclusion since April 2015 of 2 additional offences (\"disclosure of private sexual photographs and films with the intent to cause distress or anxiety\" and \"sending letters with intent to cause distress or anxiety\") that were previously non-notifiable offences. \n\nRecent changes in recording practice make interpreting trends in violence against the person offences difficult. The latest figures represent the highest volume of violence against the person offences since the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard  (NCRS) in the year ending March 2003 (11% above that recorded at the previous peak of the time series in 2005, [Table 7b][6]). \n\nIt is known that violent offences are more prone than some other offences to subjective judgement about whether or not to record a crime. The [Crime-recording: making the victim count][7] report, published by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), found that violence against the person offences had the highest under-recording rates across police forces in England and Wales. Nationally, an estimated 1 in 3 (33%) violent offences that should have been recorded as crimes were not. The ‘Accuracy of the statistics’ section has more information.\n\nAction taken by police forces to improve their compliance with the NCRS is likely to have resulted in the increase in the number of offences recorded^2^. It is thought that recording improvements are more likely to affect relatively less serious violent offences and explains the larger increase in the subcategory “violence without injury” compared with “violence with injury”. Previous evidence provided by the [National Police Chief’s Council (NPCC)][8] stated that, whilst police recorded \"violence against the person\" increased by 23% in the year ending March 2015, the number of “calls for service” relating to violent crime rose by 1%. Calls for service refer to emergency and non-emergency calls from members of the public and referrals from partner agencies (such as education, health and social services) for police to attend an incident or investigate a case. This, along with the evidence from the CSEW, suggests the rise in recorded violence against the person is largely due to process improvements rather than a genuine rise in violent crime. \n\nEvery police force recorded a rise in violence in the year ending December 2015 compared with the previous year. The largest volume increase was reported by the Metropolitan Police Service, which recorded an additional 28,546 offences compared with the previous year (an increase of 18%). Other large volume increases included West Yorkshire Police (up 19,328 offences, 77%), Hampshire Constabulary (up 16,569 offences, 67%), and Greater Manchester Police (up 11,870 offences, 31%). West Yorkshire Police had the largest percentage increase (77%); followed by: Hampshire (67%), Warwickshire (up 66% to 7,608) and West Mercia (up 64% to 21,426) ([Tables P1 and P2][9]).\n\n###Police recorded crime – domestic abuse\n\nAnother possible factor behind the rise in police recorded violent offences is an increase in the reporting of domestic abuse and the subsequent recording of these offences by the police. In 2015, the HMIC report ‘[Increasingly everyone's business: A progress report on the police response to domestic abuse][10]’ detailed the improvements in the police response to domestic abuse that had taken place across England and Wales and concluded that recent increases in the number of domestic-abuse-related crimes were due, in part, to police forces improving their recording of domestic-abuse incidents as crimes and to forces actively encouraging victims to come forward to report these crimes.\n\nThe Home Office has been collecting information from the police, since April 2015, on whether recorded offences are related to domestic abuse. Crimes are “flagged” as being “domestic abuse related” by the police if the offence meets the government definition of domestic violence and abuse^3^. Provisional data^4^ from the police for the 9 months from April to December 2015 show that \"violence against the person\" offences were the most likely to be flagged (Figure 4) with around a third (33%) of such offences flagged as domestic abuse. The offence group with the next highest proportion of offences flagged as domestic-abuse-related was sexual offences (12%). \n\n<ons-chart path=\"c643c55b\" />\n\n###Police recorded crime – homicide\n\nThe recording of homicides is not prone to changes in recording practice by the police. In the year ending December 2015, the police recorded 573 homicides, 56 more than in the previous year, which represents an increase of 11% ([Tables 7a and 7b][11]). In the last year there were 2 months with a relatively high number of recorded homicides (June 2015, 72 and November 2015, 63), while the comparator year ending December 2014 included 2 months with relatively low numbers of recorded homicide (May 2014, 30 and February 2014, 31) – this resulted in a particularly large year-on-year change in the year ending December 2015. These increases were spread across a number of police force areas.  \n\nHistorically, the number of homicides increased from around 300 per year in the early 1960s to over 800 per year in the early years of this century, which was at a faster rate than population growth over that period. Over the past decade the volume of homicides has generally decreased while the population of England and Wales has continued to grow. Based on police recorded crime data, the rate of homicide has fallen by over a third between the years ending March 2005 and December 2015, from 16 homicides per million of the population to 10 homicides per million. \n\nThere is more detailed information on trends and the circumstances of violence against the person in [Focus on Violent Crime and Sexual Offences, year ending March 2015][12]. Information on other violent crimes such as modern slavery, female genital mutilation (FGM) and hate crime is available in the ‘Violent crime’ section of the previous report [Crime in England and Wales, year ending September 2015][13].\n\n\n\n\n###Notes:\n1. Based on the latest available National Health Service (NHS) [Hospital Episode Statistics][14] and [hospital admissions due to assault (dated 24 July 2015)][15]. These don’t include figures for Wales and relate to activity in English NHS hospitals.\n2. The inspections took place over the period December 2013 to August 2014, this falls within the time period covered by the comparator year in this release.

Sexual offences are also not included in the headline estimates of crime produced from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW).\n\nPolice recorded crime figures showed an increase of 29% in all sexual offences for the year ending December 2015 compared with the previous year (up from 80,265 to 103,614; [Table 10a][1]), reaching the highest volume recorded since the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002 and marking the first time that the total number of offences has exceeded 100,000 in a given year. The latest rise remains among the largest year-on-year increases since the introduction of the NCRS, although it is not as steep as those seen in the years ending March, June and September 2015 (36% to 41%). \n\nPolice recorded rape increased by 30% (to 34,741 offences) compared with the previous year, while other sexual offences increased by 29% (to 68,873 offences). Offence categories that directly relate to sexual offences against children^2^ contributed 44% to the total increase in sexual offences recorded by the police.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"63fe9421\" />\n\nBetween the year ending March 2008 and the year ending March 2013, the trend in sexual offences was broadly flat with small increases recorded in some years. Since the year ending March 2013, the number of police recorded sexual offences has risen consistently. In 2013 the increases were generally driven by a rise in the recording of historical offences (those that took place more than 12 months before being recorded by the police), whereas the increases seen throughout 2014 and 2015 (particularly the most recent quarters) have been largely due to a rise in current offences (those that took place within 12 months of being recorded by the police). \n\nOverall, the increases are believed to have resulted from both an improvement in the recording of sexual offences by the police and an increased willingness of victims to come forward and report these crimes to the police. HMIC’s inspection of crime recording, published in late 2014, found that sexual offences had been substantially under-recorded (by 26% nationally) and led to police forces reviewing and improving their recording processes^3^. Additionally, the high-profile coverage of sexual offences, and the police response to reports of historic sexual offending (for example, through Operation Yewtree which began in 2012) are likely to have had an effect on the willingness of victims to come forward and report offences of this nature. \n\nMore information on interpreting trends in these offences can be found in [An Overview of Sexual Offending in England and Wales][2] and [Focus on Violent Crime and Sexual Offences, year ending March 2015][3].\n\n###CSEW – estimates of sexual offences\n\nDue to the small number of sexual offences identified in the face-to-face interview section of the CSEW, estimates of the volume of incidents are prone to fluctuation and therefore not included in the main CSEW estimate of crime. Since the year ending March 2005, the CSEW has included a self-completion questionnaire module on intimate violence, for persons aged 16 to 59 only, which provides an improved measure of the proportion of people who have been victims of sexual offences in this age group.\n\nMost recent headline estimates from this self-completion section of the CSEW for the year ending March 2015, released as part of the [supplementary tables][4], showed that the proportion of people who had been victims of sexual assaults in the last year (including attempted offences) had not significantly changed between the year ending March 2015 (1.7%) and the previous year (1.5%). These figures have remained fairly stable in recent years. Estimates of the proportion of people who were victims of rape or attempted rape were unchanged from the previous year (0.3%). Throughout the last 10 years, estimated levels have ranged between 0.3% and 0.6%. This provides further evidence that changes in the willingness of victims to report and in the police response are likely to be responsible for the increase in police recorded sexual offences rather than an increase in levels of victimisation.\n\nDetailed findings from the self-completion module for the year ending March 2015 CSEW are available in [Focus on Violent Crime and Sexual Offences: Year ending March 2015][5].\n\n\n\n###Notes:\n1.

There has been a general downward trend in this series over the longer-term, and the latest figures are 14% lower than in year ending March 2011. However, the majority of police forces (35 of the 44) recorded a rise in these offences compared with the previous year. The largest contributor to the total rise was the Metropolitan Police Service (accounting for 17% of the increase). Data for police force areas are published in the Home Office’s [knife crime open data table][1].\n\n<ons-table path=\"61d69dc5\" />\n\nMost of the offence groups for which data are collected showed increases, but the rise was most pronounced in the category of “assault with injury and assault with intent to cause serious harm^2^” (up 16%, from 12,611 to 14,566). \n\nFrom the year ending March 2013 to the year ending December 2015, with the exceptions of homicide and robbery offences, there have been increases in the numbers of offences where a knife or sharp instrument was used. These increases broadly reflect increases in the overall level of these offences – for example, the 16% rise in the number of “assault with injury and assault with intent to cause serious harm” offences involving a knife or sharp instrument is similar to the 15% rise seen in all incidents of this offence in the year ending December 2015. However, the increase in attempted murders involving a knife or sharp instrument (45%) is higher than the increase in total attempted murders (31%) in the year ending December 2015. This may have been influenced by improvements in crime recording, with offences previously being more likely to be recorded according to the CPS charging standard rather than the Home Office Counting Rules and the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS). For example, it might have been recorded (and charged) as another type of violent crime that is easier to prove in court, such as “wounding with intent”.\n\nIt is generally thought that some of these categories of offence are less likely to be influenced by changes in recording practice than less serious violent crime, and this latest rise may represent a real change to the downward trend seen in recent years (and a more proactive police response to knife crime). For example, in relation to the Capital, data from the London Ambulance Service showed a 9% rise in ambulance incidences resulting from assaults involving a knife injury (for the year ending October 2015, compared to the previous year^3^) . However, there is also the suggestion that recording process improvements may have been a factor. For example, anecdotal evidence relating to the Metropolitan Police Service^4^  suggests that previously, knife-related crimes where the victim was unwilling to engage with the police were being recorded on intelligence systems but not on the force’s crime recording system. Following the renewed focus on crime recording, such incidents are now being included within the crime recording system and are likely to have contributed to the rise in such offences within the statistics.\n\nOther evidence, albeit focused on the most serious knife-related crimes relating to hospital admissions for assault with a sharp instrument^5^, have shown little change over the past year following declines in previous years. For the year ending April 2015 there were 3,614 admissions for assault with a sharp instrument compared with a peak of 5,720 in the year ending March 2007^6^, although such incidents may not be representative of all knife-related crime.\n\nTaken together, the above suggests the picture is a complex one with potential contributors to the reported rise in knife crime being improvements in recording processes, a genuine rise in knife crime, and a more proactive police response to it (for example, in July 2015, some police forces stepped up activity to tackle knife crime to coincide with the introduction of a new sentencing requirement following a change in legislation). Given the complexity surrounding this issue, further investigations and discussions are being undertaken with the Home Office and police forces to build a clearer picture. Possession of a knife or sharp instrument also rose by 16% to 11,227 offences in the year ending December 2015. This figure can often be influenced by increases in targeted police action in relation to knife crime. \n\n\nFurther analysis on offences involving knives or sharp instruments has been published in [Focus on Violent Crime and Sexual Offences, year ending March 2015][2].\n\n###Offences involving firearms\n\nSimilar to the breakdown of offences involving knives or sharp instruments, statistics are available for police recorded crimes involving the use of firearms^7^. Firearms are taken to be involved in an offence if they are fired, used as a blunt instrument against a person, or used as a threat. [Focus on Violent Crime and Sexual Offences, year ending March 2015][3] has more detailed information on trends and the circumstances of offences involving firearms, including figures based on a broader definition of the types of firearm involved^8^.\n\n<ons-image path=\"d30c1e08\" />\n\nFigures for the year ending December 2015 show 5,122 offences involving firearms  were recorded in England and Wales, a 4% increase compared with the previous year (4,922, [Tables 11a and 11b][4]).This follows a general downward trend in these offences since the year ending March 2006 (Figure 6). Additional analysis of offences involving firearms by weapon type shows that the 4% increase seen in the last year is driven by increases in offences involving imitation firearms and \"other\" firearms ([Table 12][5]). Over 80% of offences involving imitation firearms were for BB guns or soft air weapons, while around 70% of offences involving other firearms were for CS gas, pepper spray or stun guns. Offences involving handguns fell by 1% over the same time period, while there was a small increase (7 offences) in those involving shotguns. Despite this latest increase, the overall level of firearms offences remained 54% below its peak.\n\nOffences involving firearms are thought to be less likely to have been affected by changes in recording practices due to their serious nature. However, there may be similar process improvements as seen with knife-related offences, given the increases seen in the less serious firearms categories. \n\n\n\n###Notes:\n1. A sharp instrument is any object that pierces the skin (or in the case of a threat, is capable of piercing the skin), for example a broken bottle.\n2.

Some victims of fraud may be unaware they have been a victim of crime, or that any fraudulent activity has occurred. Others may be reluctant to report the offence to the authorities, feeling embarrassed that they have fallen victim. The level of fraud reported via administrative sources is thought to significantly understate the true level of such crime.\n\nThis section draws on a range of sources, including police recorded crime data and data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW). While no individual source provides a complete measure of the overall extent of fraud offences, together they help to provide a fuller picture. The note [Improving crime statistics in England and Wales: Fraud][1] provides more information on what we know about the extent and nature of fraud in England and Wales and where there are gaps in the coverage of official statistics. \n\nThe police recorded crime series incorporates offences recorded by Action Fraud alongside fraud data reported to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) by 2 industry bodies: Cifas and Financial Fraud Action UK (FFA UK). Further details on the different sources of information on fraud in England and Wales are available in Section 5.4 of the [User Guide][2].\n\nFraud is an offence not currently included in the CSEW headline estimate. We are conducting work to extend the main victimisation module in the CSEW to cover elements of fraud and cybercrime. There is further information in the data sources section of this bulletin and in the methodological note, [Update – Extending the CSEW to include fraud and cyber crime][3]. Initial findings from a recent field trial of newly developed survey questions can be found in the methodological note ‘[CSEW Fraud and Cyber-crime development: Field trial][4]’. \n\n###Total recorded fraud offences - overall picture\n\nIn the year ending December 2015, a total of 617,618 fraud offences were recorded in England and Wales ([Table A4][5]), equivalent to 11 offences per 1,000 population. This represents a volume increase of 4% compared with the previous year ([Tables 22a and 22b][6]). \n\nBroken down by reporting body, fraud offences recorded by Action Fraud were broadly unchanged from the previous year at 224,683 offences. Fraud offences referred to the NFIB by the 2 industry bodies combined (Cifas and FFA UK) totalled 392,936 in the year ending December 2015. Separately, fraud offences referred by Cifas showed a 16% increase (from 254,843 offences to 295,525 offences); whereas those referred by FFA UK decreased by 15% (from 115,243 offences to 97,411 offences).\n\nVictims of fraud may report incidents to Action Fraud via an online reporting tool or via a telephone helpline. In July 2015, the company that was contracted to provide the call centre service went into administration. This led to an immediate downscaling of the call centre operation. A new contractor, who was due to take over the Action Fraud call centre in April 2016, was asked to take over operations early in August 2015. However, as the new contractor was asked to begin early at short notice it has taken some time before the call centre returned to operating at its previous capacity.\n\nMonthly volumes of fraud offences recorded by Action Fraud between August and December 2015 were lower than the totals recorded for the same period the previous year. By contrast, the total number of offences recorded during the period January to July 2015 was higher than seen in 2014. This discrepancy in the latest trends suggests that the level of fraud in the latter part of 2015 may have been subject to under-reporting since the change in operation of the Action Fraud call centre and the latest trends in Action Fraud data should therefore be interpreted with caution.\n\n###Types of fraud\n\nA full breakdown of the types of fraud offences referred to the NFIB by Action Fraud, Cifas and FFA UK in the year ending December 2015 is presented in [Appendix table A5][7].\n\nThe largest increases in categories of fraud referred to the NFIB were “banking and credit industry fraud” (up 12%, from 322,961 to 361,164 offences), “insurance fraud” (up 30%, from 8,553 to 11,152 offences) and “other frauds” (up 12%, from 34,843 to 39,000 offences).\n\nMost of the increase in “banking and credit industry fraud” was in the volume of offences reported to the NFIB via Cifas (up 30%, from 183,920 to 239,044 offences). This rise was seen principally in the sub-category of frauds relating to “cheque, plastic card and online bank accounts” and is thought to have resulted from an increase in the volume of reported identity frauds in account applications (for example, applying to open a plastic card account using a false identity). \n\n“Insurance fraud” accounts for a relatively small proportion of total fraud offences (2%), but increased by 30% from the year ending December 2014. The majority of this increase relates to frauds recorded by Cifas (as FFA UK do not collect data on this type of fraud).This is thought to have resulted specifically from a rise in insurance application frauds, largely due to an increase in the number of individuals attempting to get a cheaper policy by fraudulent means. Initiatives such as [MyLicence][8] and the [Insurance Fraud Register][9] may also be improving the insurance industry’s detection of such frauds.\n\nSeveral major categories of fraud saw decreases in the year ending December 2015 compared with the previous period. “Advance fee payments” fraud fell by 10% (from 40,866 to 36,710 offences), “telecom industry fraud (misuse of contracts)” fell by 26% (from 64,013 to 47,254 offences), “computer misuse crime” fell by 6% (from 15,322 to 14,347 offences) and “financial investments fraud” fell by 10% (from 5,973 to 5,400 offences). “Non-investment fraud”, such as fraud related to online shopping or fraudulent computer service calls, remained fairly static with 94,866 offences compared with 95,334 in the previous year.\n\nThe fall in “advance fee payments” and “financial investments” fraud and the very small increase in “non-investment fraud” is in contrast with the increases that were recorded in these categories in the year ending September 2015. Data on these types of frauds came solely from reports to Action Fraud and therefore the changes seen may be related to potential under-recording caused by the reduction in capacity of the Action Fraud call centre since August 2015 rather than a real change in the level of these frauds.\n\nMore information on the different categories of fraud and how data on them is collected is available in Section 5.4 of the [User Guide][10].\n\n###Card and bank account fraud not reported to the police\n\nData referred to the NFIB by Cifas and FFA UK are known to exclude a significant volume of card and bank account fraud. Cifas do not collect information on some types of plastic card fraud, including “remote purchase” frauds (those frauds where the cardholder and card are not present at the point of sale, such as use of the card online, over the phone or by mail order), fraud resulting from cards being lost or stolen, or ATM fraud. While FFA UK does collect this information, it only refers crimes to the NFIB in cases where there is intelligence value for the police to aid in investigating and detecting fraud. \n\nFFA UK does, however, collect information from its members on a broader range of bank account and plastic card frauds than those referred to the NFIB using a system referred to as CAMIS, and data from this source are shown in Table 4^1^. While these figures are at UK level only, they offer a broader picture of the scale of bank account and plastic card fraud. It is important to note that these data also include those cases referred by FFA UK to the NFIB (presented in [Table 22a][11]).\n\n<ons-table path=\"43f4242a\" />\n\nIn the year ending December 2015, FFA UK reported 1.5 million cases of frauds on UK-issued cards, cheque fraud, and remote banking fraud (internet and telephone banking)^2^, an increase of 16% from the previous year. This contrasts with a 15% decrease in the level of these frauds that were reported by FFA UK to the NFIB. The cases reported to the NFIB are those with intelligence value to the police and are less likely to include incidences of “remote purchase” fraud, which are a key driver in the overall increase in fraud seen by FFA UK.    \n\nAround 1.2 million (78%) of these cases were “remote purchase” frauds, which include telephone, internet and mail order fraud, making it by far the largest category. Cases of fraud using lost and stolen cards accounted for 10% of the FFA UK fraud total (152,457 offences). Given the large volume of incidents, remote purchase frauds have been important in driving overall trends in plastic card fraud. Levels seen in the other (lower volume) categories of plastic card fraud have tended to fluctuate, though the underlying trend shows that levels are higher now than 5 years ago. There have been year-on-year falls in volumes of cheque fraud since the year ending March 2013, with a 30% fall recorded in the year ending December 2015. Remote banking fraud involving internet or telephone banking increased by 53% in the latest year, although volumes were down by over a third compared with the year ending March 2011. \n\n###Measuring plastic card fraud using the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW)\n\nFraud is not currently included in the headline CSEW crime estimates (ongoing development work to address this gap is described in the ‘Data sources – coverage and coherence’ section). However, for a number of years, the survey has included supplementary modules of questions on plastic card (that is bank and credit card) fraud. These are currently reported separately from the headline estimates.\n\nThe results from the survey showed that 4.5% of plastic card owners were victims of card fraud in the last year; a similar level to the previous year’s survey. There have been small reductions in levels of plastic card fraud over the last few years, following a rise between the year ending March 2006 and year ending March 2010 surveys (Figure 7). In general, in previous years the CSEW trend in plastic card fraud has been consistent with those shown by FFA UK figures, with levels peaking around 2008 to 2010 followed by falls in subsequent years that were likely to be related to the introduction of chip and pin technology. However, the prevalence of plastic card fraud measured by the CSEW differs from the trend observed in FFA UK data, which showed a 15% rise. While the reasons for this difference are unclear at present as there are potentially many factors that can impact on either data series, the FFA UK data are likely to provide a more reliable indication of short-term trends than CSEW estimates, which can fluctuate in the short term due to sampling variability. However, the new CSEW estimates of fraud, due to be published in July 2016, may provide more detailed evidence. Further information on trends in payment industry fraud based on industry data collated by FFA UK is available in [Fraud the Facts 2015][12]. \n\nThe current level of victimisation remains higher than more established offences, for example theft from the person and other theft of personal property (0.8% and 1.5% respectively, [Table 17a][13]). Further analysis, based on the year ending March 2015 CSEW, was published as part of [Focus on Property Crime: 2014 to 2015][14].\n\n<ons-image path=\"51800d43\" />\n\n###Notes:\n1. FFA UK publish data on the volume of incidents of frauds on all payment types (including ‘remote purchase’), alongside data on financial fraud losses by the value of losses to customers. Latest figures for 2015 are available in their report ‘[2015 Financial Fraud Figures][15]’ published in March 2016.\n2. It is important to note that number of cases relates to the number of accounts defrauded, rather than the number of victims.\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/crime-stats/crime-statistics/year-ending-june-2015/sty-fraud.html\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology#user-guides\n  [3]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/crime-statistics-methodology/methodological-notes/update---extending-the-csew-to-include-fraud-and-cyber-crime.pdf\n  [4]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/crime-statistics-methodology/methodological-notes/methodological-note---csew-fraud-and-cyber-crime-development--field-trial---october-2015.pdf\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesappendixtables\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesbulletintables\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesappendixtables\n  [8]: http://www.mylicence.org.uk/about/\n  [9]: http://www.theifr.org.uk/en/about/\n  [10]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology#user-guides\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesbulletintables\n  [12]: http://www.financialfraudaction.org.uk/publications/ftf\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesbulletintables\n  [14]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/focusonpropertycrime/2014to2015\n  [15]: http://www.financialfraudaction.org.uk/cms/assets/1/downloads-7-3085-2015-year-end-fraud-update-report.pdf","title":"Fraud"},{"markdown":"###Crime Survey for England and Wales\n\nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW; previously known as the British Crime Survey) is a face-to-face survey in which people resident in households in England and Wales are asked about their experiences of crime in the 12 months prior to the interview. It covers both children aged 10 to 15 and adults aged 16 and over, but does not cover those living in communal establishments (such as care homes, student halls of residence and prisons), or crimes against commercial or public sector bodies. Respondents are interviewed in their own homes by trained interviewers using a structured questionnaire that is administered on a laptop computer using specialist survey software. The questions asked avoid the use of technical terms or legal definitions and are in plain English. \n\nThe information collected during the interview is later reviewed by a team of specialist coders employed by the survey contractors (currently TNS-BMRB) who determine whether or not what was reported amounts to a crime in law and, if so, what offence has been experienced. This “offence coding” aims to reflect the Home Office Counting Rules for recorded crime that govern how the police record offences reported to them. The CSEW is able to capture all offences experienced by those interviewed, not just those that have been reported to, and recorded by, the police. It covers a broad range of victim-based crimes experienced by the resident household population. However, there are some serious, but relatively low volume, offences, such as homicide and sexual offences, which are not included in its main estimates. Other crimes, such as plastic card fraud, are limited in their scope and are not part of the main survey.\n\nA major strength of the CSEW has been its ability to compare crime types over time and for this reason the CSEW has changed little over the last 30 years. However, the way in which criminals are operating is changing and they can now take advantage of new technologies such as the internet to both expand the scope of existing crime types and develop new ones. Nowhere has this been more apparent than in fraud and cybercrime. As questions aimed at identifying fraud and other cyber offences were not part of the original survey design, it has not been possible to include these new offences in the main estimate of CSEW crime. \n\nTo address this issue, we have been engaged in a programme of work to place questions relating to fraud and cybercrime into the survey. The research has involved several stages of development culminating in a large-scale field trial, which took place between 20 May and 9 August 2015. The aim of the trial was to replicate the existing CSEW with the addition of the new fraud and cybercrime questions. The findings of the field trial and its recommendations, including estimates of fraud and cybercrime, were published in a report, [Methodological note - CSEW Fraud and Cyber-crime development: Field trial - October 2015][1], alongside the statistical bulletin for the year ending June 2015.\n\nFollowing the success of the field trial we introduced the new questions relating to fraud and cybercrime onto half the survey sample from October 2015. This means that from March 2016, sufficient data will have been gathered to produce estimates of fraud and cybercrime using these new data. These estimates will be released in July 2016 with the regular quarterly release for the year ending March 2016. \n\nSince it began, the CSEW has been conducted by an independent (from government or the police) survey research organisation using trained interviewers to collect data from sampled respondents. The interviewers have no vested interest in the results of the survey. For the crime types and population groups it covers, the CSEW has a consistent methodology and is unaffected by changes in levels of public reporting to the police, recording practice or police activity. As such, the survey is widely seen to operate as an independent reality-check of the police figures. The independence of the survey has been further strengthened by the transfer of responsibility from the Home Office to ONS in April 2012.\n\nThe CSEW has a higher number of reported offences than police recorded crime as the survey is able to capture all offences by those interviewed, not just those that have been reported to the police and then recorded. However, it does cover a narrower range of offences than the police recorded crime collection.\n\nThe CSEW has necessary exclusions from its main count of crime (for example, homicide, crimes against businesses and other organisations, and drug possession). The survey also excludes sexual offences from its main crime count given the sensitivities around reporting this in the context of a face-to-face interview. However, at the end of the main interview there is a self-completion element (via a tablet computer), where adults aged 16 to 59 are asked about their experience of domestic abuse and sexual violence, and these results are reported separately^1^.\n\nSince the survey started in 1982 (covering crime experienced in 1981) a core module of victimisation questions has asked about a range of offences experienced either by the household (such as burglary) or by the individual respondent (such as robbery). The methodologies employed have remained unchanged since the survey started enabling a consistent measure of crimes committed against individuals to be created over the last 30 years. One such methodology involves the estimates only including the first 5 incidents in any series of repeat crimes (known as capping) to ensure that estimates are not affected by respondents who report an extremely high number of crimes that may be variable between years. With recent attention placed on where the cap currently sits^2^ (with only the first 5 incidents included), we have initiated a programme of work to investigate the effect of capping on a range of crime types and whether increasing the cap (or removing it entirely) would improve the estimates. Further information on the programme of work being conducted by us in relation to capping is available in the methodological note ‘[High frequency repeat victimisation in the Crime Survey for England and Wales][2]’.\n\nSince the survey is based on a sample of the population, estimates have a margin of quantifiable and non-quantifiable error associated with them. Non-quantifiable includes: \n\n- when respondents have recalled crimes in the reference period that actually occurred outside that period (“telescoping”)\n- crimes that did occur in the reference period that were not mentioned at all (either because respondents failed to recall a fairly trivial incident or, conversely, because they did not want to disclose an incident, such as a domestic assault)\n- respondents saying they reported a crime to the police when they did not (a “socially desirable” response)\n- some incidents reported during the interview being miscoded (“interviewer/coder error”)\n\nIn 2009, the CSEW was extended to cover children aged 10 to 15, and this release also incorporates results from this element of the survey. However, the main analysis and commentary is restricted to adults and households due to the long time series for which comparable data are available.\n\nThe CSEW has a nationally representative sample of around 35,000 adults and 3,000 children (aged 10 to 15 years) per year. The response rates for the survey in year ending March 2015 were 70% for adults and 60% for children. The survey is weighted to adjust for possible non-response bias and to ensure the sample reflects the profile of the general population. The [CSEW technical report][3] has more details of the methodology.\n\nIn July 2014, revised survey weights and a back-series were produced for the CSEW following the release of the new-2011 Census-based population estimates. [Presentational and methodological improvements to National Statistics on the Crime Survey for England and Wales][4] has more information.\n\n###Police recorded crime and other sources of crime statistics\n\nPolice recorded crime figures are supplied by the 43 territorial police forces of England and Wales, plus the British Transport Police, via the Home Office, to us. Data on fraud is sourced from Action Fraud, the UK’s national fraud reporting centre; Cifas, the UK-wide fraud and financial crime prevention service; and Financial Fraud Action UK, who co-ordinate fraud prevention activity for the financial services industry. The coverage of police recorded crime is defined by the Notifiable Offence List^3^, which includes a broad range of offences, from murder to minor criminal damage, theft and public order offences. However, there are some, mainly less serious offences, that are excluded from the recorded crime collection. These ‘non-notifiable’ crimes include many incidents that might generally be considered to be anti-social behaviour, but that may also be crimes in law (including by-laws) such as littering, begging and drunkenness. Other non-notifiable offences include driving under the influence of alcohol, parking offences and TV licence evasion. These offences are not covered in either of the 2 main series and are separately reported on in this release to provide additional context.\n\nPolice recorded crime is the primary source of sub-national crime statistics and for relatively serious, but low volume, crimes that are not well measured by a sample survey. It covers victims (including, for example, residents of institutions and tourists as well as the resident population) and sectors (for example, commercial bodies) excluded from the CSEW sample. Recorded crime has a wider coverage of offences, for example, covering homicide, sexual offences, and crimes without a specific, identifiable victim (referred to as “other crimes against society”) not included in the main CSEW crime count. Police recorded crime also provides good measures of well-reported crimes, but does not cover any crimes that are not reported to, or discovered by, the police. It is also affected by changes in reporting and recording practices. Like any administrative data, police recorded crime will be affected by the rules governing the recording of data, by the systems in place, and by operational decisions in respect of the allocation of resources.\n\nAs well as the main police recorded crime series, there are additional collections providing detail on offences involving the use of knives and firearms, which are too low in volume to be measured reliably by the CSEW. Data are also drawn from other sources to provide a more comprehensive picture. These include incidents of anti-social behaviour recorded by the police (which fall outside the coverage of notifiable offences), non-notifiable crimes dealt with by the courts (also outside the coverage of recorded crime or the CSEW), and the results of the Commercial Victimisation Surveys (based on a nationally representative sample of business premises in selected sectors each year). \n\nMore details of these sources can be found in the [User Guide to Crime Statistics for England and Wales][5]. Information on UK and international comparisons can be found in the ‘International and UK comparisons’ section of this bulletin.\n\n###Strengths and limitations of the CSEW and police recorded crime\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:top}\n</style>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n  <tr>\n    <th class=\"tg-031e\"><h4>Crime Survey for England and Wales</h4></th>\n    <th class=\"tg-031e\"><h4>Police recorded crime</h4></th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\"><strong>Positive</strong></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\"><strong>Positive</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">Large nationally representative<br>  sample survey that provides a good measure of long-term trends for the crime<br>  types and the population it covers (that is, those resident in households)</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">Has wider offence coverage and population coverage than the<br>  CSEW</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Consistent methodology over time</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Good measure of offences that are well-reported to the police</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Covers crimes not reported to the<br>  police and is not affected by changes in police recording practice; therefore<br>  is a reliable measure of long-term trends</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">The primary source of local crime statistics and for<br>  lower-volume crimes (for example, homicide)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Coverage of survey extended in 2009<br>  to include children aged 10 to 15 resident in households</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Provides whole counts (rather than estimates that are subject<br>  to sampling variation)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Independent collection of crime<br>  figures</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Time lag between occurrence of crime and reporting results<br>  tends to be short, providing an indication of emerging trends</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\"><strong>Negative</strong></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\"><strong>Negative</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Survey is subject to error<br>  associated with sampling and respondents recalling past events</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Excludes offences that are not reported to, or not recorded by,<br>  the police and does not include less serious offences dealt with by<br>  magistrates’ courts (for example, motoring offences)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Excludes crimes against businesses<br>  and those not resident in households (for example, residents of institutions<br>  and visitors) </td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Trends can be influenced by changes in recording practices or<br>  police activity</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Headline estimates exclude offences<br>  that are difficult to estimate robustly (such as sexual offences) or that<br>  have no victim who can be interviewed (for example, homicides, and drug<br>  offences)</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Not possible<br>  to make long-term comparisons due to fundamental changes in recording<br>  practice introduced in 1998 and the year ending March 2003<sup>4</sup></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Excludes fraud and cybercrime<sup>5</sup></td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">There are concerns about the quality of recording – crimes may<br>  not be recorded consistently across police forces and so the true level of<br>  recorded crime may be understated</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n###Notes:\n1.

Unless stated otherwise, all changes in CSEW estimates described in the main text are statistically significant at the 5% level. Since the CSEW estimates are based on a sample survey, it is good practice to publish confidence intervals alongside them; these provide a measure of the reliability of the estimates. Details of where these are published, including further information on statistical significance, can be found in Chapter 8 of the [User Guide][1].\n\n###Police recorded crime\n\nPolice recorded crime figures are a by-product of a live administrative system that is continually being updated as incidents are logged as crimes and subsequently investigated. Some incidents initially recorded as a crime may, on further investigation, be found not to be a crime and are then described as “cancelled records” and removed from the force’s system. Other criteria for a recorded crime being “cancelled’’ include a crime being recorded in error or if it is a duplicated or partially duplicated record. Recorded crimes can also be transferred to another police force and also result in the “transferred” record being removed from the original force’s system. Some offences may be re-classified, for example from theft to robbery (Section 3.2 of the [User Guide][2] has further details of the process involved from recording a crime to the production of statistics). The police return provisional figures to the Home Office on a monthly basis and each month they may supply revised totals for previously supplied months. The Home Office Crime and Policing Statistics team undertake a series of validation checks on receipt of the data and query outliers with forces who may then re-submit data. Details of these validation checks are given in Section 3.3 of the [User Guide][3], and the differences in data published between the current and preceding publications can be found in [Table QT1a][4].\n\nPolice recording practice is governed by the Home Office Counting Rules (HOCR) and the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS). The HOCR have existed in some form since the 1920s, with substantial changes in 1998. The NCRS was introduced in April 2002 following a critical report from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) in 2000 (Povey, 2000), which showed that  there was a problem with differing interpretation of the HOCR that resulted in inconsistent recording practices across forces.\n\nFollowing an [assessment of crime statistics by the UK Statistics Authority][5], published in January 2014, the statistics based on police recorded crime data have been found not to meet the required standard for designation as National Statistics.\n\nIn their report, the UK Statistics Authority set out 16 requirements that needed addressing in order for the statistics to meet National Statistics standards. We are working in collaboration with the Home Office Crime and Policing Statistics team and HMIC to address these requirements. A [summary of actions taken in response to these requirements is available][6].\n\nFull details on the history of the assessment and auditing of the quality and accuracy of police recorded crime statistics carried out in recent years is given in Section 3.3 of the [User Guide][7]. Since the UK Statistics Authority assessment decision, HMIC have undertaken an inspection of the integrity of police recorded crime (carried out between December 2013 and August 2014), which reviewed a total of 10,267 reports of crime recorded between November 2012 and October 2013 across all 43 police forces in England and Wales. \n\n- The final report on findings from the HMIC inspections, [Crime-recording: making the victim count][8], was published on 18 November 2014, and separate [crime data integrity force reports][9] for each of the 43 police forces in England and Wales were published on 27 November 2014\n- HMIC concluded that, across England and Wales as a whole, an estimated 1 in 5 offences (19%) that should have been recorded as crimes were not\n- The greatest levels of under-recording were seen for violence against the person offences (33%) and sexual offences (26%). However, there was considerable variation in the level of under-recording across the different offence types investigated. For other crime types: an estimated 14% of criminal damage and arson offences that should have been recorded as crimes were not; 14% of robbery offences; 11% of burglary offences; and 17% of other offences (excluding fraud).\n- Although the audit sample was not large enough to produce compliance rates for individual police forces, HMIC inspected the crime recording process in each force and have reported on their findings in the separate [crime data integrity force reports][10]\n\nThe final [HMIC report outlines several recommendations to strengthen recording practices][11] in forces, including improved training for those involved in crime recording, better auditing and tightening of recording processes. HMIC have also announced a [programme of random rolling inspections][12] to check police forces’ progress in implementing the recommended improvements. More detail can be found in the [User Guide][13].\n\nFurther evidence suggesting that there has been a recent improvement in compliance with the NCRS can be seen from updated analysis comparing trends in the CSEW and police recorded crime (presented in Section 4.2 of the [User Guide][14]). This shows that the gap between the 2 series is narrowing; suggesting that improvements to recording practices may be partly responsible for increases in recorded crime.\n\n###Interpreting data on police recorded crime\n\nThe renewed focus on the quality of crime recording means that caution is needed when interpreting statistics on police recorded crime. While we know that it is likely that improvements in compliance with the NCRS have led to increases in the number of crimes recorded by the police, it is not possible to quantify the scale of this, or assess how this effect varied between different police forces. Police recorded crime for England and Wales as a whole has increased by 7% when compared with the previous year, and 39 police forces have recorded overall increases in levels of crime.\n\nApparent increases in police force area data may reflect a number of factors, including tightening of recording practice, increases in reporting by victims and also genuine increases in the levels of crime.\n\nIt is thought that incidents of violence are more open to subjective judgements about recording and thus more prone to changes in police practice. A number of forces have also shown large increases in sexual offences, which are thought to reflect both a greater willingness among victims to report such crimes and improved compliance with recording standards for sexual offences.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology#user-guides\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology#user-guides\n  [3]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology#user-guides\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesquarterlydatatables\n  [5]: http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/assessment/assessment-reports/assessment-report-268---statistics-on-crime-in-england-and-wales.pdf\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology\n  [7]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology#user-guides\n  [8]: https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmic/publication/crime-recording-making-the-victim-count/\n  [9]: https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmic/publication/crime-data-integrity-force-reports/\n  [10]: https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmic/publication/crime-data-integrity-force-reports/\n  [11]: https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmic/publication/crime-recording-making-the-victim-count/\n  [12]: http://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmic/wp-content/uploads/cdi-technical-methodology.pdf\n  [13]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology#user-guides\n  [14]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology#user-guides","title":"Accuracy of the statistics"},{"markdown":"There is significant interest in crime statistics and a diverse range of users.

International comparisons are limited due to the differing legal systems that underpin crime statistics and processes for collecting and recording crimes.\n\n###Crimes recorded by the police\n\nThe system for recording crime in England and Wales by the police is widely recognised by international standards to be one of the best in the world. Few other jurisdictions have attempted to develop such a standardised approach to crime recording, and some of those that have base their approach on the England and Wales model (for example, Australia, Northern Ireland). Therefore, it is difficult to make international comparisons of levels of recorded crime given the lack of consistency in definitions, legal systems and police or criminal justice recording practices.\n\nThe legal system in Northern Ireland is based on that of England and Wales and the Police Service for Northern Ireland (PSNI) has the same notifiable offence list for recorded crime as used in England and Wales. In addition, the PSNI has adopted the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) and Home Office Counting Rules for recorded crime that applies in England and Wales. Therefore, there is broad comparability between the recorded crime statistics in Northern Ireland and England and Wales.\n\nHowever, recorded crime statistics for England and Wales are not directly comparable with those in Scotland. The recorded crime statistics for Scotland are collected on the basis of the Scottish Crime Recording Standard, which was introduced in 2004. Like its counterpart in England and Wales, it aims to give consistency in crime recording. The main principles of the Scottish Crime Recording Standard are similar to the NCRS for England and Wales with regard to when a crime should be recorded.\n\nThere are differences between the respective counting rules. For example, the “Principal Crime Rule” in England and Wales states that if a sequence of crimes in an incident, or alternatively a complex crime, contains more than 1 crime type, then the most serious crime should be counted. For example, an incident where an intruder breaks into a home and assaults the sole occupant would be recorded as 2 crimes in Scotland, while in England and Wales it would be recorded as 1 crime.\n\nDifferences in legislation and common law have also to be taken into account when comparing the crime statistics for England and Wales and Scotland.\n\n###Victimisation surveys\n\nA number of countries run their own national victimisation surveys and they all broadly follow a similar model to the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) in attempting to obtain information from a representative sample of the population resident in households about their experience of criminal victimisation. The US National Crime and Victimisation Survey (NCVS) is the longest running, established in 1973, and there are similar surveys in other countries, including Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and New Zealand. However, while these surveys have a similar objective they are not conducted using a standard methodology. Sampling (frames and of households or individuals) and modes of interview (for example face-to-face interviewing, telephone interviewing, self-completion via the web) differ, as do the crime reference periods (last 5 years, last 12 months, last calendar year) over which respondents are asked about their victimisation experience. Similarly, there is a lack of standardisation in question wording and order. Response rates vary considerably across the world, as do methods to adjust for any resulting possible non-response bias; therefore, it becomes extremely difficult to make valid comparisons between the surveys.\n\nThere have been attempts in the past to run international surveys on a standard basis and the International Crime and Victimisation Survey (ICVS) was initiated by a group of European criminologists with expertise in national crime surveys. The survey aimed to produce estimates of victimisation that could be used for international comparisons. The first survey was run in 1989 and was repeated in 1992, 1996 and year ending March 2005. All surveys were based upon a 2,000 sample of the population, and in most countries surveys were carried out with computer-assisted telephone interviewing. A pilot ICVS-2, intended to test alternative and cheaper modes of data collection, including self-completion via the web, was carried out in a limited number of countries in 2010.\n\nHowever, despite the attempt to obtain a standardised and comparable approach to all of the surveys, this was never successfully achieved. While a standard questionnaire was used in all countries, alongside a standard mode of interviewing, important differences remained in the approach to sampling, translation of questions into different national languages, interview lengths and response rates, which make comparisons problematic.\n\nBoth Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own separate victimisation surveys that, like the CSEW, complement their recorded crime figures.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Crime Survey (NICS) closely mirrors the format and content of the CSEW, using a very similar methodology with continuous interviewing and a face-to-face interview with a nationally representative sample of adults (16 years and over), using a similar set of questions. Therefore, results from the 2 surveys are broadly comparable.\n\nThe Scottish Crime and Justice Survey (SCJS) also follows a similar format to the CSEW, having a shared antecedence in the British Crime Survey (whose sample during some rounds of the survey in the 1980s covered Scotland, south of the Caledonian Canal). There are differences in the crimes or offence classifications to reflect the differing legal systems, but the results from the surveys are broadly comparable.\n\n","title":"International and UK comparisons"}],"unit":null,"versions":[],"headline1":null,"entities":{"persons":["Sylvia Walby","Action Fraud","Ward","Nationally","Tables","Tables P"],"organizations":["FFA","UK Statistics Authority","Wales","Monthly Ambulance Service Incidents","National Crime Recording Standard","National Health Service","Vehicle Licensing Agency","NCRS","Home Office Counting Rules","NCVS","Home Office Crime and Policing Statistics","UK","HOCR","TNS","National Statistics","US National Crime and Victimisation Survey","Home Office","Financial Fraud Action UK","Society Research Group","Methodology Information","Wales The Crime Survey","Metropolitan Police Service","Crime Statistics","Cardiff University","Commercial Victimisation Survey","Hospital Episode Statistics","Improving Crime Statistics","CSEW","SCJS","BB","Financial Fraud Figures","London Ambulance Service","International Crime and Victimisation Survey","CSEW Violence Latest CSEW","National Fraud Intelligence Bureau","Commercial Victimisation Surveys","Council","National Police Chief","Criminal","ASB","Justice Survey","Police Service","ONS","Fixed Penalty Notice","NHS","Public Administration Select Committee","Capital","CS","Wales Being","British Transport Police","NFIB","Crime Survey","Good","HMIC"],"dates":["December 2015","December 2014","March 2009","March 2007","March 2008","March 2005","December 2013","March 2006","November 2012","November 2014","March 2005 and December 2015","last year","last calendar","1973","November 2015","past year","March 2015","March 2012","March 2013","mid -

National cancer registration data for England were received from the National Cancer Registry at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which collates cancer registrations submitted by regional cancer registries in England. The Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) updates these records with the registration of death or emigration. The data used in these analyses were extracted from the live database at ONS on 2 July 2013 and provided to the Cancer Research UK Cancer Survival Group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on the 4 July 2013.\n\n2. All adults (15–99 years) who were diagnosed with a first, invasive, primary, malignancy during the period 1996–2011 were eligible for inclusion in the analyses. We excluded patients who were diagnosed with a tumour that was benign (behaviour code 0), in situ (2) or of uncertain behaviour (1). Patients were excluded if their cancer was only registered from a death certificate. Patients with zero recorded survival time were included in the analyses with one day added to their survival. Table 2 shows the number of patients excluded and Table 3 shows the final number of patients in each NHS England Area Team who were included in the analyses.\n\n\t<ons-table path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalbynhsenglandareateamadultsdiagnosed/2013-12-10/24b0230a\" />\n\n\t<ons-table path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalbynhsenglandareateamadultsdiagnosed/2013-12-10/d464a49b\" />\n\n3. Net survival in a population of cancer patients is their survival from the cancer of interest in the absence of other causes of death. It was estimated at one and five years after diagnosis for each cancer, sex and year of diagnosis. Net survival was estimated with an excess hazard model in which the all-cause mortality is modelled as the sum of the excess (cancer-related) mortality hazard and the expected (or background) mortality. The background mortality is defined by life tables from the general population. This approach enables population-level cancer survival to be estimated in the absence of detailed data on the cause of death. To obtain an unbiased estimation of net survival, age needs to be carefully modelled to account for the informative censoring associated with age  (Danieli et al., 2012).\n\n\tWe used flexible parametric models (Royston and Parmar, 2002) with age and year of diagnosis as main effects and an interaction between age and year of diagnosis. We also examined interactions between year and follow-up time and between age and follow-up time to deal with potential non-proportionality of the excess hazards over time since diagnosis. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1974) was used to select the best-fitting statistical model using the relative goodness of fit. The publicly available program, stpm2, was used to estimate net survival (Lambert and Royston, 2009). Analyses were performed in Stata 13 (Statacorp, 2013)\n\n4. Life tables were constructed for the years 1996, 2001, and 2006 using the mid-year population estimates and the mean annual number of deaths in the three years centred on those index years ([Cancer Research UK Cancer Survival Group, 2004](http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/eph/ncde/cancersurvival/research/concord/phase1.html \"Cancer Research UK Cancer Survival Group, 2004\")). Life tables for each year from 1996 to 2005 were created by linear interpolation. The life table for 2005 was used for 2006–11. Background mortality changes with time and varies by sex, age, socio-economic status and region, so life tables were created by single year of age, sex, region and deprivation quintile for each calendar year of death.\n\n5. The age distribution of cancer patients at diagnosis changes with time and varies between NHS England Area Teams. Since survival also varies with age at diagnosis, robust summary comparisons of survival require control for these differences. The directly standardised overall survival figure for each cancer is a weighted average of the age-specific survival estimates, with standard weights taken from the proportionate distribution by age and sex of patients diagnosed in England and Wales during 1996–99.\n\n\tAge-standardisation requires a set of survival estimates for each age group. It is not always possible to obtain an estimate for each combination of cancer, age group, sex and calendar year of diagnosis in geographic units with small populations because of the limited number of cases. In this situation, the missing estimate was replaced by the equivalent age-specific estimate for England.\n\n6. A 95% confidence interval is a measure of the uncertainty around an estimate. It provides a range of values which contains the true population value with a 95% level of confidence.\n\n7. NHS England was established in April 2013, following the Health and Social Care Act 2012. There are 25 NHS England Area Teams. The role of the area teams includes commissioning of primary care services (such as GP, dental and pharmacy services), supporting and developing Clinical Commissioning Groups, and working with local NHS and public health organisations. The NHS England Area Team boundaries were applied to the whole period 1996–2011, enabling geographic trends to be charted over time (Figure 2). NHS England Area Team populations range from 1.1 to 7.7 million (2011 figures) ([NHS England, 2012](http://www.england.nhs.uk/2012/06/20/local-teams-senates/ \"NHS England, 2012\")), making them more suitable for detailed statistical comparison of survival than smaller health geographies such as Clinical Commissioning Groups.\n\n8. Cancers were defined by codes in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Second Edition (ICD-O-2) (Ashley, 1990), see Table 2.\n\n9. Differences between survival estimates for the two periods are taken as the arithmetic difference: for example, 12% is shown as 2% (not 20%) higher than 10%. Survival figures are rounded to one decimal place, but the differences are based on the exact underlying figures.\n\n10.

One-year survival estimates are reported for patients diagnosed in 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011, and five-year survival for those diagnosed in 1996, 2001 and 2006.","title":"Summary"},{"markdown":"The 25 NHS England Area Teams were created on 1 April 2013. For the purpose of these analyses, patients have been assigned to the Area Team that includes their residence when they were diagnosed between 1996 and 2011.\n\nEstimates of one-year and five-year age-standardised net survival (%) are presented for each of the six cancers in tables and charts for each NHS England Area Team, by sex and calendar period. The survival estimates are age-standardised to compensate for differences in the age profile of cancer patients between Area Teams, and for changes in these age profiles over time (see Background Note 5).\n\nOne-year survival is above 60% for cancers of the colon, breast and cervix, and five-year survival for these cancers is above 45% (Figures 1A and 1B). For cancers of the oesophagus, stomach and lung, however, one-year survival is below 50% and five-year survival below 20%.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalbynhsenglandareateamadultsdiagnosed/2013-12-10/7fc5debf\" />\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalbynhsenglandareateamadultsdiagnosed/2013-12-10/1338cf58\" />\n\nAt the national level an upward trend in net survival was observed for all six cancers. The largest improvement in one-year survival among men occurred for cancers of the oesophagus, where survival increased by 19% from 26.7% for those diagnosed in 1996 to 45.4% for those diagnosed in 2011.  Five-year survival for men with colon cancer increased by 8% from 45.2% for those diagnosed in 1996 to 53.4 % for those diagnosed in 2006. For women the largest improvement in one-year survival was for cancer of the lung, where survival increased by 13% from 21.9% for those diagnosed in 1996 to 34.7% for those diagnosed in 2011. Five-year survival for women increased the most for those diagnosed with breast cancer, increasing by 9% from 75.2% in 1996 to 84.1% in 2006.\n\nThe range in one-year survival between NHS England Area Teams with the highest and lowest survival in 2011 was widest for men diagnosed with stomach cancer at 14.2% and narrowest for women diagnosed with breast cancer at 1.3% (Table 1A). For five-year survival the range between NHS England Area Teams in 2006 was widest for women diagnosed with colon cancer at 12.0% and narrowest for men diagnosed with lung cancer at 3.7% (Table 1B).\n\nThese estimates should not be used to rank NHS England Area Teams by their survival, because a change of just 1 or 2% may radically alter the ranking of a given Area Team, especially where the range of estimates is very narrow.\n\nFigure 2 presents a map of the 25 NHS England Area Teams. The geographic patterns of one-year survival (patients diagnosed in 2011) for cancer of the oesophagus, stomach, colon, lung, breast (women) and cervix are mapped in Figures 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A and 8A respectively.

National cancer registration data for England were received from the National Cancer Registry at ONS, which collates cancer registrations submitted by the National Cancer Registration Service in England. The Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSC IC) updates these records with the date of death or emigration. The data used in these analyses were extracted from the live database at ONS on 22 May 2014 and provided to the Cancer Research UK Cancer Survival Group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on 20 June 2014.\n\n2. Net survival in a population of cancer patients is their survival from the cancer of interest in the absence of other causes of death. It was estimated at one and five years after diagnosis for each cancer, sex and year of diagnosis. Net survival was estimated with an excess hazard model in which the all-cause mortality is modelled as the sum of the excess (cancer-related) mortality hazard and the expected (or background) mortality. The background mortality is defined by life tables from the general population. This approach enables population-level cancer survival to be estimated without data on the cause of death. To obtain an unbiased estimation of net survival, age is modelled to account for the informative censoring associated with age (Danieli et al, 2012).\n\n\tWe used flexible parametric models (Lambert and Royston, 2009) with age and year of diagnosis as main effects and an interaction between age and year of diagnosis. We also examined interactions between year and follow-up time, and between age and follow-up time, to deal with potential non-proportionality of the excess hazards over time since diagnosis. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1974) was used to select the best-fitting statistical model using the relative goodness of fit.\n\n\tThe publicly available program, stpm2, was used to estimate net survival (Lambert and Royston, 2009). Analyses were performed in Stata 13 (Statacorp, 2013).\n\n3. Life tables were constructed for the years 1997, 2002, and 2007 using the mid-year population estimates and the mean annual number of deaths in the three years centred on those index years (Cancer Research UK Cancer Survival Group, 2009). Life tables for each year from 1997 to 2005 were created by linear interpolation. The life table for 2005 was used for 2006-13. Background mortality changes with time and varies by sex, age, socio-economic status and region, so life tables were created by single year of age, sex, region and deprivation quintile for each calendar year of death.\n\n4. The age distribution of cancer patients at diagnosis changes with time and varies between NHS England Area Teams. Since survival also varies with age at diagnosis, robust summary comparisons of survival require control for these differences. The directly standardised overall survival figure for each cancer is a weighted average of the age-specific survival estimates, with standard weights taken from the proportionate distribution by age and sex of patients diagnosed in England and Wales during 1996-99.\n\n\tAge-standardisation requires a set of survival estimates for each age group. It is not always possible to obtain an estimate for each combination of cancer, age group, sex and calendar year of diagnosis in geographic units with small populations because of the limited number of cases. In this situation, the missing estimate was replaced by the equivalent age-specific estimate for England.\n\n5. A 95% confidence interval is a measure of the uncertainty around an estimate. It provides a range of values which contains the true population value with a 95% level of confidence.\n\n6. NHS England was established on 1 April 2013, when the Health and Social Care Act 2012 came into force. There are 25 NHS England Area Teams. The role of the Area Teams includes commissioning of primary care services (such as GP, dental and pharmacy services), supporting and developing Clinical Commissioning Groups, and working with local NHS and public health organisations. The NHS England Area Team boundaries were applied to the whole period 1997-2012, enabling geographic trends to be charted over time (Figure 1). NHS England Area Team populations range from 1.1 to 7.7 million (2011 figures) (Office for National Statistics, 2013) which makes them more suitable for detailed statistical comparison of survival than smaller health geographies such as Clinical Commissioning Groups.\n\n7. Cancers were defined by codes in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Second Edition (ICD-O-2), (World Health Organization, 1994) see Table 2.\n\n8. The six cancer sites presented in this bulletin were chosen in collaboration with Department of Health in order to represent a variety of cancer types. In particular these six cancers vary in terms of prognosis and contain some cancers for which there is a screening programme for diagnosis in England, and others for which there is no screening programme.\n\n9. Differences between survival estimates are taken as the arithmetic difference: for example, 12% is shown as 2% (not 20%) higher than 10%. Survival figures are rounded to one decimal place, but the differences are based on the exact underlying figures.\n\n10.

For the purpose of these analyses, patients have been assigned to the Area Team that currently includes their residence when they were diagnosed between 1997 and 2012.\n\nEstimates of one-year and five-year age-standardised net survival (%) are presented for each of the six cancers in tables and charts for each NHS England Area Team, sex and calendar period. The survival estimates are age-standardised to compensate for differences in the age profile of cancer patients between Area Teams, and for changes in these age profiles over time (see Background Note 4). Differences between survival estimates for the two periods are taken as the arithmetic difference: for example, 12% is shown as 2% (not 20%) higher than 10%.\n\nOne-year survival is above 60% for cancers of the colon, breast and cervix, and five-year survival is above 45% (Figures 1A and 1B). For cancers of the oesophagus, stomach and lung however, one-year survival is below 50% and five-year survival below 20%.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalbynhsenglandareateamadultsdiagnosed/2014-12-16/6174dc8b\" />\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalbynhsenglandareateamadultsdiagnosed/2014-12-16/e0892d8a\" />\n\nAt a national level, an upward trend in net survival was observed for all six cancers. The largest improvement in one-year survival between 1997 and 2012 among men occurred for cancers of the oesophagus (17.7%) and stomach (14.2%), while five-year survival for men with colon cancer increased by 8.4% between 1997 and 2007. For women, the largest improvement in one-year survival was for cancer of the oesophagus (14.2%), while five-year survival for women with breast and colon cancer increased by 8.2% and 8.1% respectively. The smallest increase at the national level for one-year survival was cervical cancer (2.7%) and for five-year survival was lung cancer in men (2.3%).\n\nThe range in one-year survival between NHS England Area Teams with the highest and lowest survival was widest for women with oesophageal cancer in 2012 (14.6%), and the narrowest was for women with breast cancer (1.6%) (Table 1A). In general, the range in one-year net survival across the 25 NHS England Area Teams is widest (8.9% or more) for the cancers where one-year survival is below 50% (oesophagus, stomach and lung). For five-year survival, the range between NHS England Area Teams was widest for women diagnosed in 2007 with colon cancer (13.9%) and narrowest for men diagnosed with lung cancer (3.7%) (Table 1B).\n\nThese estimates should not be used to rank NHS England Area Teams by their survival, because a change of just 1 or 2% may radically alter the ranking of a given Area Team, especially where the range of estimates is very narrow.\n\nThe geographic range in colon cancer survival has narrowed considerably for both sexes since 1997, especially for one-year survival: from 14.1% in 1997 to 7.2% in 2012 for men, and 17.1% in 1997 to 7.9% in 2012 for women.\n\nThe geographic patterns of one-year survival (adults diagnosed in 2012) and five-year survival (adults diagnosed in 2007) are mapped in Figures 3A-8.\n\n<ons-table path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalbynhsenglandareateamadultsdiagnosed/2014-12-16/32f5ef69\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalbynhsenglandareateamadultsdiagnosed/2014-12-16/0d08fef2\" />\n","title":"Results"},{"markdown":"####Figure 2: NHS England Area Team boundaries, 2014\n<ons-image path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalbynhsenglandareateamadultsdiagnosed/2014-12-16/figure2_tcm77-389131.png\" />\n######Source: Office for National Statistics, Ordnance Survey","title":"NHS England Area Team boundaries"},{"markdown":"One-year age-standardised net survival improved considerably for adults diagnosed between 1997 and 2012.

Net survival is the probability of survival derived solely from the risk of death from cancer, compensating for the risk of death from other causes (background mortality). Background mortality is accounted for through life tables [11] of all-cause mortality rates for the general population in England. For convenience, net survival is expressed as a percentage in the range 0 to 100%. We applied rules restricting the analyses to cancers and periods of follow-up for which sufficient data were available to make robust estimates of survival. This is because survival estimates are unstable when there are few patients at risk initially and when the number of patients at risk drops sharply over time. Survival at a certain time since diagnosis is only reported if at least 10 patients were alive at that time and if there were at least 5 events in either the years before or the years after; additionally, at least 1 event in the years before this time is required.\n\n2. The “complete approach” to estimating survival is applied [12], including all patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2014. Survival is estimated using the Pohar-Perme estimator [13], which provides unbiased estimates of net survival at all ages. Survival is estimated using the publicly available stns algorithm [14] in STATA 14 software. Conversely, the hybrid approach is used for short-term predictions when the follow-up data are more recent than the data. It is effectively a hybrid of the complete and period approaches, in which the most recent follow-up data for up to 10 years are combined with follow-up data for the first few years after diagnosis from the most recent cohort for which such data are available. It provides more precise estimates, with narrower confidence intervals, because it includes additional subjects who contribute to the conditional probabilities of survival in the period immediately after diagnosis [18]. \n\n3. Net survival varies with age, and the age profile of cancer patients varies with time and between geographical areas. Estimates are age-standardised to allow for comparison over time and between different geographical areas. The weights used to age-standardise survival can be found in Coleman et al [15]. \n\n4. Confidence intervals (95%) can be found in the reference tables. A 95% confidence interval is a measure of the uncertainty around an estimate. It provides a range of values which contains the true population parameter with a 95% level of confidence.\n\n5. All adults (aged 15 to 99 years) in England who were diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 with 1 of the 24 most common cancers as an invasive, primary, malignant neoplasm were eligible for inclusion in the analyses. Ineligible patients were those whose tumour was benign (not malignant) or in situ (malignant but not invasive) or of uncertain behaviour (uncertain whether benign or malignant), or for which the organ of origin was unknown. Details of the eligibility and exclusion criteria have been published [16]. \n\n6. Cancers were defined by anatomic site codes in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and by morphology and behaviour codes in the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Second Edition (ICD-O-2) (reference table 6).\n\n7. The 2 changes implemented for the 2012 publication of the national cancer survival statistics have been maintained this year, namely:\n\n\t(i) Net survival, using an unbiased estimator [13], instead of relative survival.\n\n\t(ii) Patients with zero follow-up time are included: these are patients known to have died on the same day as they were diagnosed. Patients for whom a death certificate was the only information available are excluded, because the duration of their survival is unknown.\n\n8. Data are presented for cancer of the colon and cancer of the rectum separately, and also combined (colorectal cancer). \n\n9. Differences between any 2 survival estimates are taken as the arithmetic difference: for example, 12% is shown as 2% (not 20%) higher than 10%. Differences are based on the exact underlying survival estimates, but they are shown in the bulletin at 1 decimal place or integer. \n\n10. When the data for this report were extracted for analysis on 18 April 2016, cancer registrations in 2014 were believed to be at least 99% complete, and each patient's vital status at 31 December 2015 was known for 99% of cancers registered between 2010 and 2014. As in other countries, cancer registration is a dynamic process; a small number of late registrations may arrive up to 5 years after the end of a given calendar period, whereas other registrations may be amended or deleted. The figure of 99% completeness is based on the average number of cases for the 3 previous years (2011 to 2013), including late registrations received after publication of the data for those years.\n\n11.

The UK Statistics Authority has designated these statistics as National Statistics, in accordance with the [Statistics and Registrations Service Act 2007][4] and signifying compliance with the [Code of Practice for Official Statistics][5].

The estimates of 1-, 5- and 10-year survival are based on patients diagnosed with 1 of 24 common cancers in England. Taken together, these cancers comprise 91.1% of all newly diagnosed cancers (based on the number of cancer diagnoses in England [1]). \n\nData are presented for men, women and both sexes combined. Five of the cancers only occur in 1 sex (cervix, ovary, uterus, testis and prostate). We present survival for cancer of the larynx only in men, and for breast cancer only in women, because those 2 cancers are rare in the opposite sex. We report survival by age group and for all ages combined. To allow the comparison of survival between cancers with a different age profile, all-ages survival estimates are age-standardised. Confidence intervals are provided, to indicate the precision of the survival estimates. \n\nWe have published 1-year and 5-year survival in this bulletin for many years, but this is the first time that 10-year survival estimates have been presented, using the hybrid approach [2].

To ensure that the 10-year estimates are timely they have been calculated using a predictive survival method. To complement and provide context for the 10-year estimates we have also provided 1- and 5-year survival estimates using the same method. Due to the predicted nature of these estimates, only cancer sites that produce robust results are included.\n\nFigures 5 and 6 show predicted age-standardised net survival at 10-years for men and women who would be diagnosed in 2015. Survival is predicted for these patients because cancer incidence data for 2015 were not available at the time of the analysis. This is done using the hybrid approach [2]. 10-year survival can be predicted, assuming that the conditional probabilities of surviving for patients diagnosed in 2015 are equal to those diagnosed between 2005 and 2014 (the most recent data available). The predicted estimate is conservative in a situation where survival is improving. \n\nFor men, survival is above 50% for 7 of the 8 cancers (melanoma of the skin, prostate, kidney, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colon, colorectal and bladder) for which sufficient data are available. Consistent with 5-year survival figures, we observe the highest survival for melanoma of the skin (87.2%). Leukaemia has the lowest 10-year survival estimates at 44.8%. In women, we see a similar pattern to men for 5 of the 6 cancers for which sufficient data were available. Melanoma of the skin, breast, cervix, kidney and colorectal cancer have a survival estimate that is greater than 50%, except leukaemia, where 10-year survival is 44.7%. \n\nThe greatest difference between men and women is observed for melanoma of the skin, with 10-year survival 4.3% lower for men (87.2% versus 91.5%).\n\n<ons-chart path=\"1bcbac63\" />\n\n<ons-chart path=\"2c2f059f\" />","title":"10-year survival"},{"markdown":"[Dataset table 5][1] presents age-specific predicted net survival at 1-, 5- and 10-years after diagnosis for each of the most common cancers. There are distinct patterns in survival by age group, with generally lower survival estimates among older patients, even after taking into account the fact that the elderly are also more likely to die of other causes. Two well-known exceptions to this pattern are prostate and breast cancer. \n\nFor instance, for prostate cancer (Figure 7), 5-year survival is slightly higher for men aged 50 to 69 years (ranging from 93.1% to 93.9%) than for men aged 15 to 49 years (at 92.6%). This trend remains consistent for 1- and 10-year survival. This may be partly due to more widespread (but not national) use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test in older men. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"89886e6a\" />\n\nA similar trend can be seen for breast cancer in 1-year, 5-year and 10-year survival estimates (Figure 8). Survival is higher for women aged 40 to 69 than for their younger peers (15 to 39 year olds). For example, 5-year survival is lower for women aged 15 to 39 years at diagnosis (85.5%) than for women aged 40 to 69 years (ranging from 90.7% to 93.0%). These differences are probably explained at least in part by breast screening for women aged 50 to 70, and by the National Health Service introducing an age extension trial in 2009 [5], where some younger women (aged 47 to 49 years) and some older women (aged 71 to 73 years) are invited for screening. The national breast cancer screening programme identifies cancer patients at an earlier stage than in older age groups [6]. Screening aims to detect a tumour at an earlier stage of cancer, which helps improve survival.  \n\n<ons-chart path=\"b6440ecc\" />\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/cancersurvivalratescancersurvivalinenglandadultsdiagnosed","title":"Predicted survival in each age group for patients diagnosed in 2015"},{"markdown":"Overall, cancer survival has been improving steadily in England but it is still lower than in comparably wealthy countries.

Net survival is an estimate of the probability of survival from the cancer alone. It can be interpreted as the survival of cancer patients after taking into account the background mortality that the patients would have experienced if they had not had cancer. Background mortality is derived from life tables of all-cause mortality rates in the general population. Net survival varies with age, and the age profile of cancer patients can vary with time and between geographical areas, so the estimates are age-standardised to facilitate comparison. Estimates are shown with their 95 per cent confidence intervals (see Background Note 6). For convenience, net survival is expressed as a percentage in the range 0–100 per cent.\n\n2. There are two changes to the statistical methods for patients diagnosed during 2006–2010. First, an unbiased estimator of net survival (Pohar Perme, Stare and Estève, 2012) has been used instead of the conventional relative survival. Net survival accounts for the so-called \"informative censoring\" bias, i.e. the fact that some groups of patients are less likely than others to be observed until death, independently of their cancer prognosis. Second, patients with zero follow-up time have been included. These are patients known to have died on the same day as they were diagnosed; they do not include patients for whom a death certificate was the only information available. Survival for patients diagnosed during 2005–2009 has been re-estimated with this revised approach and the results are shown in [Table 1](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-277733 \"Reference Table Page\"); the estimates differ slightly from those published for the same patients last year, but they are directly comparable with the survival estimates published today for patients diagnosed during 2006–2010.\n\n3. All adults (aged 15–99 years) in England who were diagnosed during 2006–2010 with one of the 21 most common cancers as an invasive, primary, malignant neoplasm were eligible for analysis. Ineligible patients were those whose tumour was benign (not malignant) or in situ (malignant but not invasive) or of uncertain behaviour (uncertain whether benign or malignant), or for which the organ of origin was unknown. Details of the eligibility and exclusion criteria have been published (Coleman et al., 1999).\n\n4. Cancers were defined by anatomic site codes in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and by morphology and behaviour codes in the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Second Edition (ICD-O-2) ([Table 3](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-277733 \"Reference Table Page\")).\n\n5. Data presented for the 21 most common cancers are for cancer of the colon and cancer of the rectum separately. Combined data for colorectum cancer are also presented.\n\n6. A 95 per cent confidence interval is a measure of the uncertainty around an estimate. It provides a range around the estimated value within which we have a 95 per cent level of confidence that the true value for the population is likely to fall.\n\n7. Differences between survival estimates for the two periods are taken as the arithmetic difference: for example, 12 per cent is shown as 2 per cent (not 20 per cent) higher than 10 per cent. Survival figures are rounded to one decimal place, but the differences are based on the exact underlying figures.\n\n8. When the data for this report were extracted for analysis on 18 May 2012, cancer registrations for 2010 were believed to be 97 per cent complete, and the patient’s vital status at 31 December 2011 was known for 99 per cent of cancers registered for the period 2006–2010. As in other countries, cancer registration is a dynamic process: a small number of late registrations may arrive up to five years after the end of a given calendar year, whereas other registrations may be amended or deleted. The figure of 97 per cent completeness is based on the average number of cases for the three previous years (2007–2009), including late registrations received after publication of the data for those years.\n\n9.

[Table 1](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-277733 \"Reference Tables Page\") compares net survival estimates (with their 95 per cent confidence intervals) (see Background Note 6) for patients diagnosed with one of the 21 most common cancers during the period 2006–2010 with the corresponding values for patients diagnosed during 2005–2009 ([Office for National Statistics, 2011](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cancer-unit/cancer-survival-rates/2005-2009--followed-up-to-2010/stb-cancer-survival--2005-09-and-followed-up-to-2010.html \"STB Cancer survival, 2005-09 and followed up to 2010\")) (see Background Note 7).\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalinenglandadultsdiagnosed/2012-10-23/b27df85d\" />\n\nThe general trend of increasing five-year net survival (Rachet et al., 2009) continued for patients diagnosed during 2006–2010, with survival improving for all of the 21 most common cancers ([Table 1](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-277733 \"Reference Tables Page\")). The largest increases in five-year survival, compared with the corresponding values for patients diagnosed during 2005–2009, were for men diagnosed with myeloma (an increase of 3.2 percentage points to 41.4 per cent), and for women diagnosed with colon cancer (survival rose 1.7 percentage points to 55.7 per cent), rectal cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (an increase of 1.6 percentage points to 58.1 and 66.7 per cent, respectively). Generally increasing trends were also seen for one-year survival (data not presented).\n\nFive-year net survival is over 80 per cent for cancers of the breast (women), prostate and testis, and for Hodgkin lymphoma and melanoma of skin ([Figure 1](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-277733 \"Reference Tables Page\")). Prognosis remains very poor for malignancies of the brain, lung, oesophagus, pancreas and stomach, ranging from 3.9 and 4.4 per cent for cancer of the pancreas in men and women, respectively, up to 17.3 and 20.4 per cent for brain tumours. For all other cancers, five-year survival ranges from 38.3 to 66.8 per cent.\n\n[Table 2](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-277733 \"Reference Tables Page\") presents net survival at one and five years after diagnosis for each of the 21 most common cancers, by sex and age group, and for all ages combined, both un-standardised and age-standardised.\n\nThere are distinct patterns in net survival by age, with generally higher survival among younger patients and lower survival among older patients, even after taking account of the higher background mortality in the elderly. Breast cancer is a well-known exception to this pattern ([Rachet et al., 2008](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/other/british-journal-of-cancer--rachel-et-al--2008-.html \"British Journal of Cancer, Rachel et al., 2008\")); five-year net survival is lower for women aged 15–39 years at diagnosis (84 per cent) than for women aged 40–69 years (89 to 90 per cent). Similarly, for prostate cancer, five-year survival is somewhat lower for men aged 15–49 years (90 per cent) than for men aged 50–69 years (92 per cent).\n\n","title":"Results"},{"markdown":"Key users of cancer survival estimates include the Department of Health, academics and researchers, cancer charities, cancer registries, other government organisations, researchers within ONS, the media, and the general public. The Department of Health uses cancer survival figures to brief parliamentary ministers, and as part of the evidence base to inform cancer policy and programmes, for example in drives to improve survival rates.\n\nCancer survival estimates will also be used to measure progress against [NHS Outcomes Framework](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/other-government-departments/doh/nhs-outcomes-framework.html \"NHS Outcomes Framework\") indicators. Academics and researchers use the figures to inform their own research. Similarly cancer registries and other government organisations use the figures to carry out individual and collaborative projects to apply subject knowledge to practice.\n\nCharities use the data so they can provide reliable and accessible information about cancer to a wide range of groups, including patients and health professionals via health awareness campaigns and cancer information leaflets/web pages.

Survival estimates for cervical, colorectal and breast cancer are some of the lowest among Member States of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The strategy document sets out how the Department of Health aims to improve outcomes for all cancer patients and improve cancer survival, with the aim of saving an additional 5,000 lives every year by 2014/15.\n\nOutcomes strategies set out how the NHS, public health and social care services will contribute to the ambitions for progress agreed with the Secretary of State in each of the high-level outcomes frameworks.

The period approach to estimate survival is used to predict the survival for patients who were diagnosed more recently, and for whom long-term follow-up data are not yet available.  However, the period approach cannot be used when the follow-up data are more recent than the incidence data, as in the current situation: follow-up data to the end of 2013, while the incidence data are only available up to the end of 2012. In such a situation, the hybrid approach is applied (Brenner et al. 2004); the survival estimates can be interpreted as the survival of patients who would be diagnosed in 2013.\n\n3.

Figures 3 and 4 show five-year net survival for these same cancers. These estimates are presented in Table 1, with 95% confidence intervals (see Background Note 7), and compared with the corresponding values for patients diagnosed during 2007–2011 ([Office for National Statistics 2013](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cancer-unit/cancer-survival/cancer-survival-in-england--patients-diagnosed-2007-2011-and-followed-up-to-2012/index.html \"Cancer Survival in England: Patients Diganosed 2007-2011 and Followed up to 2012) (see Background Note 8).\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalinenglandadultsdiagnosed/2014-10-30/797d742e\" />\n\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalinenglandadultsdiagnosed/2014-10-30/1a8ccde7\" />\n\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalinenglandadultsdiagnosed/2014-10-30/ff315c70\" />\n\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalinenglandadultsdiagnosed/2014-10-30/594fc393\" />\n\n\nThe general trend of increasing five-year net survival continued for patients diagnosed during 2008–2012, with survival improving for most of the 24 cancers. There were five exceptions: bladder cancer in women (49.1% for patients diagnosed during 2007–2011, 48.0% for those diagnosed during 2008–2012), thyroid cancer in men (82.9%, 81.8%) and women (87.3%, 86.8%), testicular cancer (97.1%, 96.6%), Hodgkin lymphoma in women (86.0%, 85.7%) and mesothelioma in men (6.4%, 6.3%). For cancers that occur in both sexes, survival is generally higher in women, with one notable exception: bladder cancer (48.0% in women, 59.7% in men).\n\nThe five-year survival estimate for women diagnosed with myeloma during 2008–2012 was 46.2%, an increase of 4.6 percentage points from the value for 2007–2011: since the two periods overlap by four years, this is a large increase. There were other large increases for men with myeloma (up 3.9 percentage points to 46.7%) and men with leukaemia (up 2.5 percentage points to 49.5%). Generally, there were also increasing trends for one-year survival (data not presented).\n\nThere is a clear separation in five-year survival between the seven cancers with the poorest prognosis and all other cancers. Estimates are below 19% in men and 22% in women for cancers of the brain, lung, oesophagus, liver, pancreas and stomach, and mesothelioma. Five-year survival ranges from 5.4% for pancreatic cancer in men and women, up to 18.9% in men and 21.2% in women for brain tumours (Table 1). Prognosis from these cancers remains extremely poor, despite some encouraging recent improvements in one-year survival (data not presented). For all other cancers, five-year survival ranges from 46.2% for myeloma in women to 96.6% for testicular cancer.\n\nFive-year net survival is over 80% for cancers of the breast (women), prostate, thyroid gland, Hodgkin lymphoma and melanoma of the skin (men), and above 90% for testicular cancer (96.6%) and for melanoma of the skin in women (92.6%). However, because of increasingly intensive diagnostic activity, an increasing proportion of men with prostate cancer and, to a lesser extent, women with breast cancer, are diagnosed with tumours at an early stage. These patients are more likely to die from causes other than the cancer. Estimating survival by stage is therefore of increasing public health importance for these cancers. When reliable data on stage are available for all cancer patients in England for a full five year period, it will be possible to estimate stage-specific survival routinely, in order to monitor progress more effectively at a national level.\n\nTable 2 presents net survival at one and five years after diagnosis for each of the 24 common cancers, by sex and age group, and for all ages combined, both un-standardised and age-standardised.\n\nThere are distinct patterns in net survival by age, with generally lower survival among older patients and often higher survival among younger patients, even after taking account of the higher background mortality in the elderly. Breast cancer is a well-known exception to this pattern; five-year net survival is lower for women aged 15–39 years at diagnosis (85%) than for women aged 40–69 years (90% to 92%), because of screening activity in middle-aged women and differences in tumour characteristics between the age groups. Similarly, for prostate cancer, five-year survival is slightly higher for men aged 60–69 years (94%) than for men aged 15–49 years (91%). This is probably attributable to very early diagnosis following more widespread use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test in older men.\n\n","title":"Results for patients diagnosed in 2008–2012"},{"markdown":"New developments in the estimation of cancer survival now enable relatively accurate short-term predictions of survival for patients who were diagnosed more recently, and for whom long-term follow-up data are not yet available. These methods (period and hybrid, see Background Note 2) are not just projections into the future of recent trends in survival: they use the most recent data on the follow-up of cancer patients to 31 December 2013. The methods do depend on certain assumptions, but experience has shown that they are relatively reliable predictions of the five-year survival that we will be able to report when all the cancer patients have been followed up for at least five years.\n\nIn this bulletin, the hybrid estimates of age-standardised survival can be interpreted as the predicted one- and five-year survival for patients diagnosed in 2013. We have included these estimates to provide the most recent possible estimates of survival.\n\nFigures 5, 6, 7 and 8 show the predicted age-standardised net survival at one and five years, in rank order, for the 24 common cancers in men and women that would be diagnosed in 2013 (see Background Note 2). Table 3 presents the predicted one-year and five-year survival estimates for patients diagnosed in 2013, by sex and age group, and for all ages combined, both un-standardised and age-standardised. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalinenglandadultsdiagnosed/2014-10-30/23182a37\" />\n\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalinenglandadultsdiagnosed/2014-10-30/569884a2\" />\n\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalinenglandadultsdiagnosed/2014-10-30/bbdd6c46\" />\n\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/cancersurvivalinenglandadultsdiagnosed/2014-10-30/d625a186\" />\n\n\nFor most cancers, the predicted survival for patients diagnosed in 2013 is higher than for those diagnosed during 2008–2012. The largest increases in one-year survival are for men with myeloma and kidney cancer, and for men and women with mesothelioma and lung cancer. The largest improvements in five-year survival are for prostate cancer, for women with kidney cancer, and for men and women with myeloma. The only exceptions to the overall trend are for five-year survival in men with cancers of the larynx and thyroid gland.\n\n","title":"Predicted survival for patients diagnosed in 2013"},{"markdown":"Overall, cancer survival in England has been improving steadily.

All children (aged 0–14 years) resident in England who were diagnosed during 1990–2006 with a malignant neoplasm or a non-malignant neoplasm of the central nervous system (CNS), as defined in the third edition of the International Classification of Childhood Cancer ([Steliarova-Foucher et al., 2005](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.20910/pdf \"Steliarova-Foucher et al., 2005\")), were considered eligible for analysis. Children whose tumour was only reported on a death certificate were excluded, because their duration of survival is unknown.\n\n2. We report the cumulative probability of all-cause (overall) survival up to 5 years after diagnosis using the actuarial method. This means that all deaths are included in the analysis, whatever the cause of death written on the death certificate. For adults, the net survival indicator is used to compensate for mortality from other causes, which may be considerable. For children, overall survival is considered a reliable estimator of cancer survival because, unlike in adults, death within five years of diagnosis is almost always due to the cancer.\n\n3. Survival varies with age at diagnosis, and the age profile of patients can change over time. To enable comparison of overall survival for the age range 0–14 years over long periods of time, age-standardised estimates are calculated as a weighted sum of the age-specific survival estimates. For children, it is conventional to use equal weights for the three five-year age groups, 0–4, 5–9 and 10–14 years, by taking the simple arithmetic mean of the age-specific survival estimates\n\n4. For the line graph showing trends in survival estimates over time, we present smoothed survival trends. These have been done using lowess (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing) because of the year-to-year variation in the survival estimates. Lowess is one of many techniques used to smooth unstable estimates in order to highlight patterns in the data such as temporal trends. Because the survival estimates in Figure 1 are smoothed, they are not identical to the corresponding survival estimates in Table 1. (Cleveland, 1979).\n\n5. When the data for this report were extracted for analysis on 10 April 2013, childhood cancer registrations for 2005–2010 in England were believed to be 99.7% complete, and the patient’s vital status at 31 December 2011 was known for 98.7% of cancers registered for the period 1990–2006. As in other countries, cancer registration is a dynamic process: a small number of late registrations may arrive up to five years after the end of a given calendar year, whereas other registrations may be amended or deleted.\n\n6.

The [NHS Outcomes Framework][1] was established to monitor overall changes in performance of the NHS and the quality of health outcomes.\n\nThis bulletin includes data on survival for all children (aged 0–14 years) diagnosed with cancer in England during 1990-2006, followed up to 31 December 2011 (see Background Note 1). Five-year survival estimates are presented for all cancers combined, for each year from 1990 to 2006 (see Background Note 2). Survival estimates are reported by age group and for all ages combined, both unstandardised and age-standardised (see Background Note 3).\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/other-government-departments/nhs/nhs-outcomes-framework-2013-14.html \"NHS Outcomes Framework 2013 to 2014\"","title":"Summary"},{"markdown":"Figure 1 shows smoothed five-year survival estimates for children diagnosed with cancer in England between 1990 and 2006, for age groups 0–4, 5–9, and 10–14 years, and age-standardised survival for all ages combined (see Background Note 4).\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/childhoodcancersurvivalinengland/2013-12-10/944c6aea\" />\n\nFor all children (0–14 years) diagnosed with cancer in 2006 and followed up to the end of 2011, overall age-standardised five-year survival was 81.3% ([Table 1 (105.5 Kb Excel sheet)][1]). Five-year survival among those aged 5–9 years was 83.5%, slightly higher than for children aged 0–4 years (79.0%) or 10–14 years (81.3%).\n\nFor all childhood cancers combined, five-year survival has increased fairly steadily, from 66.6% for children diagnosed in 1990 to 81.3% for children diagnosed in 2006. This is an absolute increase of 14.7% over a 17-year period, or about 1% each year.\n\nThe increase of 17.0% in five-year survival for children aged 5–9 years at diagnosis was somewhat larger than the increases seen among children aged 0–4 years (12.5%) and children aged 10–14 years (14.6%).\n\nGradual increases in survival over the period 1990–2006 are likely to be a result of improvements in treatment and supportive care (Stiller, 2007). These increases occurred in parallel with improvements in outcomes reported by relevant clinical trials of treatments for childhood cancers ([Stiller et al., 2012](http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/9/2464.full.pdf \"Stiller et al., 2012\")). The increase was slightly greater for those aged 5–9 years at diagnosis than for children who were younger or older at diagnosis. This is probably due to variation in the relative frequency of the different types of cancer with age. For example, the 5–9 years old age group contains relatively few cases of neuroblastoma (mainly found in younger children) and bone sarcoma (more frequent in older children), two types of cancer for which increases in survival have been relatively small.\n\nMore than half of all the childhood cancers diagnosed during the period 1990–2006 were leukaemias (32%) and malignant neoplasms of the brain and central nervous system (26%).\n\nDetailed results are presented in [Table 1 (105.5 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cancer-unit/cancer-survival-for-children-in-england/children-diagnosed-1990-2006-and-followed-upto-2011/rft---childhood-cancer-survival.xls \"RFT - Childhood Cancer Survival \")    in the associated data section of this publication.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cancer-unit/cancer-survival-for-children-in-england/children-diagnosed-1990-2006-and-followed-upto-2011/rft---childhood-cancer-survival.xls \"RFT - Childhood Cancer Survival\"","title":"Results"},{"markdown":"Key users of cancer survival estimates include the Department of Health, academics and researchers, cancer charities, cancer registries, other government organisations, researchers within ONS, the media, and the general public. The Department of Health uses cancer survival figures to brief parliamentary ministers, and as part of the evidence base to inform cancer policy and programmes, for example in drives to improve survival rates. Cancer survival estimates will also be used to measure progress against [NHS Outcomes Framework](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/other-government-departments/nhs/nhs-outcomes-framework.html \"NHS Outcomes Frameworks\") indicators. Academics and researchers use the figures to inform their own research. Similarly cancer registries and other government organisations use the figures to carry out individual and collaborative projects to apply subject knowledge to practice. Charities use the data so they can provide reliable and accessible information about cancer to a wide range of groups, including patients and health professionals via health awareness campaigns and cancer information leaflets/web pages. Researchers within ONS use the data to support further research and to publish alongside other National Statistics.\n\n","title":"User and uses"},{"markdown":"In ‘[Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/other-government-departments/doh/dh---improving-outcomes--a-strategy-for-cancer.html \"DH - Improving outcomes: a strategy for cancer\")’ (January 2011), the Department of Health stated that although improvements have been made in the quality of cancer services in England, a significant gap remains in survival compared with the European average. The strategy document sets out how the Department of Health aims to improve outcomes for all cancer patients and improve cancer survival, with the aim of saving an additional 5,000 lives every year by 2014/15.\n\nOutcomes strategies set out how the NHS, public health and social care services will contribute to the ambitions for progress agreed with the Secretary of State in each of the high-level outcomes frameworks. The indicator set for the NHS Outcomes Framework 2013–2014 includes five-year survival from all cancers in children under 15 years. This indicator on childhood cancer survival has been introduced to the [NHS Outcomes Framework for the first time in 2013–2014](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/other-government-departments/nhs/nhs-outcomes-framework-2013-14.html \"NHS Outcomes Framework\"). Cancer is responsible for 21% of all deaths in children aged 1–14 and causes more death of children in this age group than any other cause, so an indicator for this group is clearly important.\n\n","title":"Policy context"},{"markdown":"Tsion Solomon^a^, Sarah Whitehead^b^, Michel P Coleman^a^, Charles Stiller^c^ \n\n### Notes for authors\n\n1. ^a^Cancer Research UK Cancer Survival Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\n\n\t^b^Cancer Analysis Team, Office for National Statistics\n\n\t^c^Childhood Cancer Research Group, University of Oxford\n\n","title":"Authors"},{"markdown":"The National Cancer Registry at the Office for National Statistics, the Childhood Cancer Research Group and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine wish to acknowledge the work of the regional cancer registries in England, which provided the raw data for these analyses.\n\n","title":"Acknowledgements"}],"unit":null,"versions":null,"headline1":null,"entities":{"persons":["Solomon","Charles Stiller","Sarah Whitehead","Michel P Coleman"],"organizations":["London School","Office","Office for National Statistics","DH","Department of Health","NHS Outcomes Framework \"","Childhood Cancer Research Group","Cancer Research UK Cancer Survival Group","RFT - Childhood Cancer Survival","NHS Outcomes Framework","Cancer Research Group","Kb Excel","ONS","NHS","Tropical Medicine ^","Cancer Analysis Team","National Statistics","London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine","University of Oxford","NHS Outcomes Frameworks \"","National Cancer Registry","Cancer"],"dates":["January 2011","2013 - 14","2007","2006","December 2011","2004","2014","2013","2013 - 12 - 10","1990","2012","1990 - 2006"],"locations":["England","London"]},"headline2":null,"headline3":null,"relatedData":[{"uri":"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/cancersurvivalforchildreninenglandreferencetables"}],"relatedMethodology":[],"preUnit":null},"matched_queries":["logged_featureset"]}],"max_score":0.0},"timed_out":false,"_shards":{"total":19,"successful":19,"skipped":0,"failed":0}}]
