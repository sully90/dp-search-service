Specifically, this referred to the aggregates RPI and RPIX and also the component indices of RPI (for example food and clothing). \n\nSince then, some users have sought further clarification.

Similarly, the RPIX is used in a range of contracts and exposure is traded in swap form. These indices, along with all sub-components of the RPI, are considered essential and will continue to be published. A full list of sub-components is available in Annex A.\n\n###Composite Price Index\n\nDecision: Continue to publish and explore using the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and CPIH for more recent data\n\nThis constructs a long-run series from various sources, going back to 1750. From 1947 onwards, RPI is used. There is value in maintaining a long-run series for research and comparability purposes and exploring the option of using CPIH for more recent data is reflected in our [development plan][1] for Consumer Price Indices.\n\n###Average prices\n\nDecision: Continue to publish and explore moving away from the RPI basis used for uprating prices\n\nWe publish average prices for a range of homogeneous products in the inflation basket of goods and services. Currently, an average price is calculated using January data. For subsequent months, this price is uprated using the relevant RPI component index. There remains significant interest in these data. Developing a new method for calculating average prices using CPIH is reflected in our [development plan][2].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/consumerpricesdevelopmentplan/2016-10-11\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/consumerpricesdevelopmentplan/2016-10-11",

              "markdown": "###RPIJ\n\nDecision: Discontinue publication. We will adapt the current reconciliation of RPI and CPI to compare RPI and CPIH and will publish a direct estimate of the formula effect on RPI.\n\nThe RPIJ was developed in early 2013 to highlight the impact of the use of the Carli formula on the RPI. The [Review of UK consumer price statistics][1], led by Paul Johnson, noted that the RPIJ was not widely used and appeared to lead to confusion. It recommended that ONS consults on discontinuing RPIJ and should continue to produce a reconciliation of the difference between RPI and the main measure of inflation. There was also little support for the measure from respondents to the consultation. The [National Statistician’s letter][2] published in March 2016 stated that RPIJ would be discontinued.\n\nAlthough some additional uses of RPIJ have since emerged, there remain strong arguments against continuing to publish it: \n\n-\tunless there is a strong justification, having multiple measures does not encourage a clear understanding of inflation in the UK \n\n-\tRPIJ shares the weaknesses of the RPI that go beyond the Carli formula, such as population coverage and use of a direct measure of house prices to estimate owner occupiers’ housing costs\n\n-\twhilst the RPI and thereby the RPIJ, will continue to be maintained through routine changes, we will not invest additional resource into its development \n\nTo continue with a measure of inflation that has these shortcomings will not help to create clear and coherent understanding of inflation in the UK.\n\nWe currently produce a reconciliation between RPI and CPI, which includes an estimate of the formula effect. This will be adapted to compare RPI and CPIH, at the point when CPIH becomes the preferred measure. However, it is clear that there is value in having a measure that specifically illustrates the formula effect on the RPI, a purpose that is currently served by RPIJ. For this reason, we will publish an estimate of the formula effect on RPI, but it will not form part of the family of price indices. \n\n###Tax and Prices Index (TPI)\n\nDecision: Discontinue publication\n \nThe TPI measures how much the average person’s gross income needs to change to purchase the basket of goods, allowing for the average amount of Income Tax and National Insurance paid on earnings.\n\nThere was very little support for TPI in the consultation responses and we are not aware of wider use of the index. Producing this on a CPIH basis would require considerable resource investment, which is not justified given the level of interest. \n\n###RPI excluding mortgage interest payments and indirect taxes (RPIY)\n\nDecision: Discontinue publication\n\nThe RPIY excludes mortgage interest payments and indirect taxes. Whilst CPIY has a policy application, this is less evident for RPIY and there was relatively little support for it in the consultation. \n\n###RPI Pensioners’ Indices\n\nDecision: Discontinue publication\n\nSome respondents to the consultation noted significant use of the RPI pensioner indices in monitoring the inflationary pressures on pensioners. Beyond the methodological limitations of the RPI, these indices are not well suited to this task as their coverage is limited to those pensioner households excluded from the coverage of the RPI (that is to say where the head of the household is of pensionable age and economically inactive and where at least three-quarters of the household’s income is from state benefits). This means that neither the RPI, nor the RPI pensioner indices, provide a complete picture of the inflationary pressures on pensioners. The development of measures of income, expenditure and price change for different household groups is a better starting point for this type of analysis.\n\n###Rossi index\n\nDecision: discontinue publication\n\nThe Rossi index is a variant of RPI that excludes housing costs. It was introduced in 1983 to uprate income related benefits. In 2011, the CPI replaced the RPI and Rossi as the measure used for uprating, with the exception of the basic state pension, which continued to use RPI for 2011 only, before moving to CPI in 2012. Given the index is no longer used for the specific purpose for which it was designed, it will be discontinued from March 2017.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports-and-correspondence/reviews/uk-consumer-price-statistics-a-review/\n  [2]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Letter-from-John-Pullinger-to-Sir-Andrew-Dilnot-090316.pdf",

Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. One way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. Most of our price indices are published monthly.\n\nIn the UK, the main measure of inflation is the CPI. The CPI is a measure of consumer price inflation produced to international standards and in line with European regulations. First published in January 1996 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets.\n\nOther major measures of consumer price inflation include:\n\n###CPIH\n\nA measure of UK consumer price inflation that include owner occupiers’ housing costs, which are important components of household expenditure. In March 2016, the National Statistician announced the intention for CPIH to become our preferred measure of inflation.\n\n###Retail Prices Index (RPI)\n\nA long-standing measure of UK inflation that has historically been used for a wide range of purposes such as the indexation of pensions and rents and index-linked gilts. In accordance with the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, the Retail Prices Index and its derivatives have been assessed against the Code of Practice for Official Statistics and found not to meet the required standard for designation as National Statistics.\n\n###RPIJ\n\nA variant of RPI which is calculated using formulae that meet international standards.\n\nThe CPI and other indices measure a wide range of prices.\n\nThe price of cars or hi-fi equipment might fall while the price of food or petrol may rise. The indices represent the average change in prices across a wide range of consumer purchases. This is achieved by carefully recording the prices of a typical selection of products from month to month using a large sample of shops and other outlets (including the provision of goods and services via the internet) throughout the UK.\n\nThe rest of this article explains how the CPI is compiled.\n\nThe approach used for other indices is generally very similar, although some specific differences are highlighted later in this guide.\n",

The content of the basket is fixed for a period of 12 months, however, as the prices of individual products vary, so does the total cost of the basket. The CPI, as a measure of that total cost, only measures price changes. If people spend more because they buy more goods this is not reflected in the index.\n\nThe quantities or \"weight\" of the various items in the basket are chosen to reflect their importance in the typical household budget.\n\nIn practice of course we all spend different amounts on various goods and services that show different price movements.\n\nWhile no one is \"average\", it is still convenient to have summary price measures which, although they may not strictly apply to any one individual or family, will still give us a useful yardstick of the impact of inflation on our own pocket or purse.\n\nConsiderable care is taken to ensure that the shopping basket is kept up-to-date and is representative of people’s spending patterns: the places and shops we go to, the goods and services that we buy and the amounts we spend on them.\n",

The index simply indicates what we would need to spend in order to purchase the same things we bought in an earlier period, irrespective of whether particular products are \n\"needed\" or are \"good for you\". For example, cigarettes are included in the index as many people buy them. However, the calculations reflect the average shopping basket and so also take account of the fact that many people do not buy tobacco.\n",

Many owner-occupiers’ housing costs are also currently excluded from the CPI, however since March 2013 we have published a newer measure of consumer price inflation called CPIH which includes these costs.\n\nIt is impractical and unnecessary to monitor the price of every product sold in every single shop. The prices of similar items can reasonably be assumed to move in line with one another in response to market forces. It is therefore sufficient to compile the index using prices of a large and varied sample of products in selected locations. The goods and services for which prices are recorded are called \"representative items\".\n\nThe CPI is compiled using around 700 separate representative items. Their movements are taken to represent the price changes for all goods and services covered by the index, including those for which prices are not specifically monitored. There are, for example, several items in the basket covering purchases of bread – such as a large white sliced loaf and large wholemeal loaf – that are combined together to estimate the overall change in bread prices.\n\n<ons-table path=\"a11fadfb\" />\n",

In this case, an index which did not take account of improved quality would\nshow higher inflation than an index that does adjust for quality change.\n\nA simpler example occurs where a manufacturer changes the size or weight of a product. For example,\nthis has happened with the size of some confectionery products being reduced. Not adjusting for this change\nwould result in an index showing lower inflation than an index that is adjusted for the change.\n\nIn this way, quality adjustment helps to focus the index on \"underlying\" price changes for a fixed basket of goods\nand services.",

The weights are mainly derived from the Household Final Monetary Consumption Expenditure component of the national accounts.\n\nThe weights for the Retail Price Index (RPI) and RPIJ are derived from a number of sources but mainly from our Living Costs and Food Survey.

They also record details of major purchases over a longer period.\n\nIn calculating the weights for the RPI and RPIJ, the expenditure of certain private households are excluded. Households whose income is within the top 4 per cent of all households and pensioner households which derive\nat least three quarters of their total income from state pensions and benefits are excluded on the grounds that\nthe spending of these groups are significantly different from the majority.

One way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket  containing goods and services typically bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket by calculating the average of price changes of the items within the basket.^1^\n\nHowever, we know that households spend more on some goods and services than others, so we would expect, for example, a 10% increase in the price of petrol to have a much bigger impact on the basket than a similar rise in the price of tea. For this reason, the components of price indices are weighted; using the amount we spend on these items as consumers, to ensure that it reflects the relative importance of the various items in the average shopping basket.\n\nThe various weights used in the calculation of consumer price inflation, along with the items that form the “shopping basket” are reviewed and updated each year. This ensures weights remain representative of current household expenditure patterns and reflect the introduction of new items into the shopping basket and removal of old ones. A separate article is published that explains the [annual update to the content of the consumer price inflation basket of goods and services][1].\n\n#####Notes for What is a weight?\n\n1.

The first 2 types of weights are used to produce the item indices (that is, combining the individual items within the basket), the next is used to combine items into higher level indices (that is, COICOP level indices) and the last is used for all levels above this. Aggregation is explained further in section 4 or via the [technical manual][1]. This article will now focus on the COICOP level weights. \n\nIn 2017, a new, additional level of the COICOP classification has been introduced. This new level of detail, known as COICOP5 will sit between the existing class (or COICOP4) level indices and item level indices. Further detail on the impact of introducing this new level of classification can be found in the October 2016 article explaining [methodological improvements on the consumer price indices][2].\n\n###3.1 Data sources for CPIH and CPI weights\n\nIn consumer price inflation, expenditure weights are designed to reflect the expenditure patterns of the target population of households covered by the index. CPIH and CPI have a different target population to the Retail Prices Index (RPI)^1^ and therefore have different expenditure weights, and thus a different source of data underpinning the weight.\n\nThe CPIH and CPI cover all expenditure within the UK by:\n\n- private households\n- residents of institutions such as university halls of residence or nursing homes\n- visitors to the UK from abroad\n\nInformation on spending patterns, which underpin the CPIH and CPI weights, largely come from the household final consumption expenditure (HHFCE)^2^ component of the UK National Accounts. These data are used because the expenditure information is comprehensive and balanced against data collected in other sectors of the economy to create the most accurate picture of consumer spending. However, there are a few exceptions where additional source data are used to supplement the HHFCE data and improve the coherence with the intended scope of the indices.\n\n- the Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) is used to supplement HHFCE data in the calculation of weights for air travel, package holidays and actual rentals\n- the International Passenger Survey, which is also used in the calculation of a weight for air travel\n- the public sector component of the national accounts, which is used in the calculation of the weight for passport fees\n\nThe HHFCE expenditure used in the annual update of CPIH and CPI weights is always the latest available calendar year national accounts dataset that is available at the time of weights calculation, that are consistent in methodology with the latest published Blue Book. The annual CPIH and CPI weights update takes place in January each year, so the weights are sourced from the latest national accounts update in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) of the preceding year. For example, for the 2017 weights update, the latest set of HHFCE expenditure was taken from the Quarter 3 2016 National Accounts dataset. This data is consistent with the most recent Blue Book release ([Blue Book 2016][3], published in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) of 2016). In all cases the current price measure (as opposed to the chained volume measure) is used. Effectively, the 2017 weights are calculated using a more up-to-date version of data in [Table 6.4][4] of Blue Book 2016: Individual consumption expenditure at current market prices by households, non-profit institutions serving households and general government: classified by function.\n\nThis approach to the use of the latest national accounts data is consistent over time and will remain so into the future. \n\n###3.2 Methodology behind the update of COICOP weights and above\n\nHigher level CPIH and CPI weights (that is, at the COICOP level and above) are updated annually with the January index (published in February), followed by a further update with the February index (published in March) due to the introduction of [improved methodology][5] (the “double link”) for the production of consumer price inflation and to coincide with the introduction of new items to the basket of goods and services. The underlying expenditure in each COICOP grouping is converted to an expenditure share relative to total household expenditure for the overall basket and given an integer weight in parts per thousand so that the sum of the weights equals 1,000.\n\nThe weights are based on the latest available calendar year’s HHFCE data; however, this data is not timely enough for immediate use in consumer price indices due to the lag at which national accounts data is published. For example, in Blue Book 2016 the latest available calendar year is 2015. To make the expenditure data as up-to-date as possible, we can restate the expenditure in current prices using a process called price updating.\n\nTo explain further, for a given index year y, the weights are based on the latest available national accounts expenditure from y minus 2.\n\nAt the first annual update of weights (published with the January index), the expenditure needs to be price updated to December of year y minus 1. For the 2017 weights this would mean expenditure from the calendar year 2015 is updated to December 2016 by applying the respective change in price between 2015 and December 2016. This process is applied at the lowest level of COICOP within the weighting structure using the accompanying price movement for that COICOP level in CPIH and CPI (this process is presented in formula in [Annex E][6] of the CPIH compendium).\n\nAt the second update of weights, published with the February index, the same underlying 2015 expenditure is updated to January of year y. So for the 2017 weights this would mean expenditure from the calendar year 2015 is updated to January 2017 by applying the respective change in price between 2015 and January 2017. This approach ensures the latest available expenditure is adjusted so that it is suitable for use in the calculation of consumer price inflation weights.\n\nFurther details on this double update approach can be found in the October [2016 methodology article][7] and [Annex E of the CPIH compendium][8]. \n\nThere are 2 further aspects of the annual weights update that warrant a mention.\n\nFirstly, when calculating the CPIH and CPI weights for insurance (such as insurance connected with the dwelling, travel, health and transport) an average of the most recent 3 years data is used in line with international regulation. As insurance expenditure is recorded on a net basis (the difference between expenditure on insurance premiums and the amount paid out in claims) this approach safeguards against exceptional cases where the amount paid out in claims could exceed the amount paid in premiums.\n\nSecondly, the [revisions][9] policy for consumer price statistics means that indices are not usually revised historically. Published weights for consumer price inflation reflect the best available understanding of what households spend their money on in the UK at the time they were produced. Whilst the source data are often revised at a later date, these revisions are not taken into the calculation of weights, that is, only the latest calendar year’s data are used in each weights update. As such, the changes in weights between years may reflect changes in data sources, methods and definitions, as well as changes in spending patterns. For this reason, the weights should not be used to analyse trends in consumer spending over time.\n\n#####Notes for How do we calculate weights in consumer price indices?\n\n1.

              "markdown": "The revisions policy outlined in section 3.2 means that consumer price statistics are not usually revised historically. In recent years, revisions to expenditure used in the calculation of CPIH weights and in particular the owner occupier housing component (OOH), have been taken on as exceptional cases. These revisions occurred in 2015 and more latterly in the 2017 weights update and will be explained in more detail in this section.\n\nThe production of national accounts estimates is typically open to revision as new methods and improved data sources become available. In 2015, it was announced that [substantial improvements were being made to the measurement of imputed rentals for housing][1] in the national accounts that were scheduled to be published in Blue Book 2016. Imputed rentals^1^ is the [method used to measure the weight of the OOH component of CPIH][2]. Given the likely size of the revisions in national accounts and the potential of introducing a large step change in the OOH weight we took the opportunity to revise the OOH expenditure alongside [methodological improvements][3] that were also being introduced to the processing of private rents data in CPIH in February 2015. Only the OOH-related expenditure was revised in CPIH and no revisions were made to CPI expenditure.\n\nThe main purpose of this approach was to mitigate as far as possible a future step change in OOH weights and to get the full set of OOH weights in CPIH on a consistent expenditure basis back to 2005. To do this, in early 2015 national accounts estimated expenditure for imputed rentals that was consistent with the methods being implemented in Blue Book 2016. These estimates were calculated in an offline system and were for use in the 2015 revision of the OOH weight only and as such were not published. Full details of the [revision and impact on CPIH][4] were published in the February 2015 article.\n\nAs it turned out, when national accounts published 2016 Blue Book, the estimates of imputed rentals, as calculated in the national accounts system were lower than the offline estimates provided in 2015. This resulted in a notable fall in the 2016 OOH weight. However, it had been announced that [CPIH was to be revised in 2017 to introduce Council Tax][5]. This again presented a further opportunity to update the OOH expenditure so that the series would be on a consistent basis back to 2005 (using the latest published imputed rentals data from Blue Book 2016). An article assessing the [impact of revising OOH][6] weights, along with the introduction of Council Tax was published in December 2016.\n\nThe publication of 2017 weights for CPIH now sees the OOH component on a consistent basis and Council Tax included. Aside from some small refinements planned for Blue Book 2017 there are no further substantial methodological changes planned for imputed rentals and aside from the changes discussed above, large revisions are not commonplace. We do not expect to revise expenditure weights for CPIH or CPI in the foreseeable future. For more information on the calculation of OOH weights, please see [section 2.4][7] of the CPIH compendium. \n\n#####Notes for The revision of CPIH weights\n\n1.

              "markdown": "Having defined how and why weights are calculated in consumer price indices, it is worth defining the various levels of aggregation that weights are used in the production process.\n\nThe CPIH and CPI are classified according to the Classification Of Individual COnsumption by Purpose, commonly referred to as COICOP. This is the international classification of household expenditure and is used in the production of national accounts, Living Costs and Food (LCF) Survey and consumer price indices. COICOP enables the consistent classification of individual consumption expenditure incurred by households, non-profit institutions serving households and general government according to their purpose.\n\nIn previous years (prior to 2017) there were 4 COICOP levels, with the fourth COICOP level being commonly referred to as “class level” within consumer prices. Items within these levels are aggregated together using expenditure weights up to the first COICOP level – the headline CPIH or CPI. \n\n<ons-image path=\"05797f16\" />\n\nTraditionally the class level was the first building block of aggregation, however, as of March 2017 a new, more detailed level has been introduced into CPIH and CPI aggregation. This new level is referred to as COICOP5 and it will sit between the existing COICOP 4 level indices and item level indices. Effectively the COICOP5 classification will replace COICOP4 as the first building block of aggregation in consumer price indices and is the level at which HHFCE expenditure is delivered and COICOP-based weights in consumer price indices are first calculated. Further details on the [introduction and impact of COICOP5][1] can be found in the October 2016 article.\n\n<ons-image path=\"4737d79b\" />\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/assessingtheimpactofmethodologicalimprovementsontheconsumerpricesindex",

              "markdown": "This section considers the largest weight changes between 2016 and 2017, focusing on the revised CPIH weights and explains the reasons for these changes. These published weights reflect the best available understanding of what households spent their money on at the time the weights were produced. Differences in the weights between years can reflect changes in data sources, methods and definitions, as well as changes in consumer spending in the UK over time. Therefore these weights should not be used to compare consumer spending over time.\n\nThis section will firstly take a look at the CPIH divisional level weights (COICOP2 level) and drill down through the structure to explain any movements when compared to revised 2016 weights. Additionally, any notable lower level movements are also explained. The tables in [Annex A][1] present the latest (February 2017 updated) CPIH weights (Table W3) and CPI weights (Table W1) from 2005 onwards. The CPIH weights in Table W3 have been revised back to 2005 to incorporate Council Tax and revised imputed rentals expenditure. The latest RPI weights (Table W2) are also included for reference.\n\n###6.1 Summary of weight changes\n\nThe update of 2017 weights has seen the introduction of [2 methodological improvements][2] as explained in section 3:\n\n- the introduction of a new COICOP level, known as COICOP5\n- the introduction of a double chain-link methodology\n\nBoth of these improvements are common to CPIH and CPI. In addition to this, for CPIH only, Council Tax has been introduced into the basket of goods and services, whilst the weight of the OOH component of CPIH has been revised back to 2005 to reflect the expenditure published in the 2016 Blue Book. Whilst the CPIH tables in Annex A have been updated to reflect the revised weights, the weights prior to revision can be accessed via [Annex A of the 2016 weights article][3].\n\nTo reflect these improvements, the analysis in this section presents the revised 2016 weight, along with the January 2017 update of weights and the February 2017 update of weights, followed by an explanation of any notable movements when comparing with 2016.\n\n<ons-table path=\"ef1a8363\" />\n\nTable 1 presents the CPIH divisional level COICOP weights. The most notable movements will be explained further in this section, firstly focusing on the comparison of January 2017 updated weights to the revised 2016 weight and then explaining any change between the January 2017 and February 2017 update. Typically, changes in weight between years can be caused by 2 factors:\n\n- a change in the underlying expenditure used to calculate the weight\n- a change in the price factor applied to price update the expenditure\n\nThis year, however, the change between years has been complicated by the introduction of improvements mentioned previously and the revision of OOH weight. The change when comparing the February 2017 update against the January 2017 update will be driven by any notable movement in price factor, which is used to price update the underlying expenditure.\n\n####Division 01 Food and non-alcoholic beverages\n\nThis division has a weight of 83 parts per thousand (ppt) in the revised 2016 CPIH weights, which has fallen to 81ppt in the January 2017 update of weights. There are 11 classes making up the division, ranging from bread and cereals through to coffee, tea and cocoa. No one class is driving the fall in weight.  In general, the underlying household expenditure used to calculate the weights is relatively flat between years. The January 2017 weights for three classes; meat, milk and vegetables have all seen a small fall of 1ppt between 2016 and 2017, offset by a small increase of 1ppt in the coffee, tea and cocoa class.\n\nThe weight for this division remains the same at the February 2017 update.\n\n####Division 02 Alcoholic beverages and tobacco\n\nThis division has a weight of 34ppt in revised 2016 weights, which has now fallen to 33ppt in the January 2017 update of weights. This fall is driven by one class – tobacco, which has seen a fall in weight from 19ppt to 18ppt. Whilst the underlying expenditure on tobacco has fallen slightly, this is further exacerbated by a fall in the price updating ratio of approximately 1% between what was used in 2016 and 2017 (note this doesn’t mean the price of tobacco was falling, just that the price didn’t increase as much between 2016 and 2017).\n\nThe weight for this division then increases by 1ppt, to 34ppt at the February 2017 update. This increase is driven by the spirits class, which saw an increase in price of almost 7% between the update of weights. This price increase pushed up the underlying expenditure causing the weight to increase from 4ppt in the January update to 5ppt in February 2017.\n\n####Division 03 Clothing and footwear\n\nThis division has a weight of 58ppt in revised 2016 CPIH weights, which has increased to 60ppt in the January 2017 update. There are 6 classes that make up this division, with a new class being introduced in 2017 as part of the COICOP 5 improvement to cover clothing materials. However, the increase in weight seen between 2016 and January 2017 is driven by the garments class, which saw an increase in weight from 44ppt to 45ppt. This increase for garments came from an increase in the underlying expenditure of approximately 4% along with an increase of around 1% in the price updating factor.\n\nThe weight for the clothing and footwear division then falls from 60ppt in the January update to 58ppt in the February 2017 update. This movement is again driven by the garments class, which falls from a weight of 45ppt in the January update to 44ppt in the February update. This is caused by a fall in the price update factor of approximately 5% between the January and February 2017 updates.\n\n####Division 04 Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels\n\nFurther detail on the revisions to weights caused by the revision of imputed rentals and introduction of Council Tax can be found in section 4 of this article or the December 2016 [article assessing the impact of revising OOH weights][4]. Beyond this, the change in divisional weight is relatively flat between 2016 and 2017.\n\nTable 2 presents the old published OOH weight (as published in 2016 before revision), and the revised 2017 update (including Council Tax and revised imputed rentals expenditure).\n\n<ons-table path=\"43fa52b6\" />\n\nWhilst looking at division 04, it is also worth considering the classes for electricity and gas. These two classes can tend to see their weights fluctuate between years. However, in this latest update the weights for both classes have remained relatively stable. The February 2017 updated weight for electricity is 13ppt, down from 14ppt in revised 2016 CPIH weights, whilst the accompanying weight for gas is 12ppt, the same as revised 2016 CPIH weights.\n\n####Division 07 Transport\n\nThis division has a weight of 122ppt in revised 2016 CPIH weights, which has increased to 127ppt in the January 2017 update. The most notable increase is found in the second-hand cars class. This class has seen an increase of 1ppt between 2016 revised weights (13ppt) and the January 2017 update weights (14ppt). This increase in second-hand cars is driven by an increase in expenditure of approximately 13% between these periods.\n\nThe weight for this division then falls from 127ppt in the January 2017 update to 126ppt in the February update. There is a downward contribution of 2ppt coming from the class for passenger transport by air. This class had a weight of 6ppt at the January 2017 update, however, a substantial fall in price of approximately 36% between the January and February 2017 update has reduced the underlying expenditure in this class culminating in a 2ppt reduction in February 2017 to stand at 4ppt.\n\n####Division 08 Communication\n\nThis division has seen a notable fall in weight from 25ppt in the revised 2016 CPIH weights, to 21ppt in the January 2017 update. This fall in weight has been driven by the improvements from introducing a more detailed level of the COICOP classification. In previous years, prior to the COICOP5 introduction, an estimate for the bundled communications component of the telephone and telefax services class had to be derived. This was estimated using data from the Living Cost and Food survey. However, the new COICOP5 level of classification now includes a separate component for bundled communications, meaning that the data no longer needs to be estimated. The previous estimate of bundled telecommunications was higher than the now systemised estimate available following the introduction of COICOP5, so this decrease in expenditure is driving a fall in weight for the class of 4ppt.\n\nThere is no further change in the weight for this division (or classes) between the January 2017 and February 2017 weight update.\n\n####Division 10 Education\n\nThis division has seen a fall in weight from 20ppt in revised CPIH 2016 weights to 17ppt in the January 2017 update.  The introduction of COICOP5 has again had an impact here, where under the old version of COICOP this division only included 1 class for education, under the new COICOP5 classification it has been split into 5 separate classes, such as pre-primary and primary education, secondary education and tertiary education. This is also coupled with a fall in the level of household final consumption expenditure (HHFCE) expenditure used in the calculation of education weights from £19.6 billion used in 2016 (for calendar year 2014, consistent with Blue Book 2015) compared to £18.3 billion in the 2017 update (for calendar year 2015, consistent with Blue Book 2016). The HHFCE 2014 expenditure for education has been revised down to £17.8 billion in Blue Book 2016; this revised data is not used.\n\nHowever, there is no further change in the weight for this division (or classes) between the January 2017 and February 2017 weight update.\n\n####6.2 Other notable class movements\n\nThis final section draws out some notable COICOP class level movements in weight, which have not already been covered in section 6, again focusing on CPIH.\n\n#####Class 90600, package holidays\n\nThis class has a weight of 29ppt in revised CPIH 2016 weights, which has fallen to 28ppt in the January 2017 update.  This fall has been driven by a fall of approximately 2% in the price updating ratio applied between 2016 and 2017 weighting. Before this price update is applied, the underlying expenditure is essentially flat. This class weight remains the same at 28ppt in the February 2017 update.\n\n#####Class 110101, restaurants, cafes and the like\n\nThis class has seen a fall in weight from 74ppt in the revised CPIH 2016 weights to 70ppt in the January 2017 update. This fall is driven by almost a 4% fall in the underlying HHFCE expenditure used in the weights calculation. The level of 2015 expenditure (used in the 2017 update of weights) for catering services in Blue Book 2016 is approximately £84billion, which is a fall from the level of 2014 expenditure published in Blue Book 2015 (and used in the 2016 weights update) of £87.3billion. However, the 2014 level of HHFCE expenditure has been revised down in the Blue Book 2016 to £82.2billion, but in accordance with the consumer price indices revision policy, these revisions to expenditure are not taken on (unless there are exceptional circumstances).\n\n#####Class 110200 accommodation services\n\nThis class has seen a weight increase from 17ppt in revised CPIH 2016 weights to 24ppt in the January 2017 update. The reason for the change in weight is similar to that for restaurants, cafes and the like in that it is driven by revisions to HHFCE data. The level of 2015 expenditure for accommodation services in Blue Book 2016 is approximately £26billion, which is almost a 40% increase from the level of 2014 expenditure published in Blue Book 2015 (and used in the 2016 weights update) of £18.6billion. However, the 2014 level of HHFCE expenditure has been revised upwards in the Blue Book 2016 to £23.6billion, but in accordance with the consumer price indices revision policy, these revisions to expenditure are not taken on (unless there are exceptional circumstances).\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/w1tow3tablesannexa\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/assessingtheimpactofmethodologicalimprovementsontheconsumerpricesindex\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/cpihcompendium/2016-10-13#annex-e-equations-used-in-the-calculation-of-owner-occupiers-housing-costs\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/impactofinclusionofcounciltaxandrevisedimputedrentsoncpih/dec2016",

However, the RPI uses a formula which does not meet international best practice and as a result its designation as a [National Statistic][1] was cancelled in 2013. The RPI will continue to be maintained through routine changes, but methodological improvements will only be made if, to not do so, would inhibit the improvement of CPI and CPIH. From 2017, we will only publish RPI-related data which is essential to the needs of users. \n\nThe CPI and CPIH work programme feeds into the higher ONS business plan (National Accounts and Economic Statistics (NAES) directorate, Economic Transformation, “Better statistics better decisions”. We have allocated appropriate resources.\n\nThe aim of this development plan is to provide you with information on the plans in place for CPI and for making CPIH the main measure of inflation, how this work feeds into the ONS business plan and to show that appropriate resources have been allocated to this plan and that we are aware of the potential risks.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/national-statistician/types-of-official-statistics/",

              "markdown": "###3.1 Introduction\n\nThe work programme has been updated to reflect decisions reached by the National Statistician^1^ following the 2015 consultation on consumer price statistics^2^. The consultation followed a review led by Mr Paul Johnson (commonly referred to as the Johnson Review) which took a comprehensive look at how inflation is measured in the UK and made a series of recommendations about the future development of these statistics^3^. The programme and priorities also reflect the priority placed on the use of alternative data sources by Professor Sir Charles Bean’s review of economic statistics (commonly referred to as the Bean Review)^4^. \n\nWe expect that our top priorities for the next few years will be to:\n\n- gain accreditation of CPIH as a [National Statistic][1] and refocus commentary on this measure\n- continue to develop the use of alternative data sources such as web scraping and point of sale scanner data\n- publish annual measures of income and price change as experienced by different household types\n- research the concepts and issues raised by the Household Inflation Index (HII) report^5^ and implement these into inflation measures where this is deemed appropriate\n- consider ways to address the formula differences between RPI and CPI\n\nFor us to be at the cutting edge of international research for consumer price indices, the programme will need to continuously evolve in light of new priorities. Therefore we will review and update this work programme periodically and an update will be provided each September to the Authority Board via the National Statistician. \n\nIn updating the work programme, we will seek the guidance of the [Advisory Panels on Consumer Prices][2] and engage with experts and users of these statistics.\n\n###3.2 High priority\n\nHigh priority items are the cornerstone of the development programme and if necessary will be prioritised over the delivery of medium and low priority items. High priority items are listed in order of implementation (of the first deliverable).\n\n####3.2.1 Use of alternative data sources\n\n#####Overview\n\nImprovements in technologies have resulted in new, alternative, sources of price data which could be used in the compilation of price indices. There are 2 main alternative data sources which could be used, specifically:\n\n- point of scale scanner data - often referred to as scanner data, collected by retailers as goods are scanned across the till; these data are often considered the gold standard for consumer prices statistics as the data include both price and volume information\n\n- web scraped data - collected using automated robots which scan retailers’ websites and extract price information\n\nThe Johnson Review and Bean Review recommended that ONS should give priority to obtaining these data, developing methods and capabilities to use them. The National statistics Quality Review (NSQR)^6^ of the Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) made several recommendations on accessing scanner and web scraped datasets, and this work will need to be carefully co-ordinated. ONS currently has several streams of research looking at these alternative sources of data. These are:\n\nSince May 2014, we have scraped daily prices from 3 large supermarket websites, collecting around 150,000 prices monthly for 35 grocery items. Preliminarily indices using this data were published in September 2015^7^ and the indices were updated again in May 2016. Following this publication, we will work towards a more regular release of these indices.\n\nIn 2015, web-based platforms for extracting data from websites began to become widely available. They use a point and click interface which enables analysts to create web scrapers without the need for specialist programming expertise. This form of web scraping is now used to support the production of hedonic models which are used to quality adjust 4 high-tech goods in the basket. The hedonic models require detailed attribute data which have historically been collected manually from websites. Where possible web scraped data extracted using this technology have been used to replace this data collection. \n\nThis technology has also been used to pilot web scraping for 10 centrally collected items in the CPI basket. The scrapers have been designed to replicate the manual online collection so existing index number methodology can be applied. The pilot started in January 2016 and the scrapers are run once a month. Depending on the success of the pilot, import.io could be used as a monthly price collection tool from early 2017.\n\nRecently we have obtained web scraped data for clothing websites from a company called WGSN. The suitability of this data for creating price indices will be assessed and a report published in mid-2017.\n\nWe are investigating the potential use of a database of rail fares transactions owned by the Association of Train Operating Companies, to improve the rail fares item in CPI. Whilst not strictly speaking scanner data, this database does have many similar characteristics to retailer transaction data, that is it holds a near census of transactions.\n\nFinally, whilst previous efforts to obtain scanner data have proved unsuccessful, there are renewed efforts within ONS, led by senior managers, to obtain such data from retailers. The timeframe to implementation is dependent on the acquisition of data and in the interim the use of web scraped data is the priority. However, if scanner data are received, the balance of priorities between web scraping and scanner data will be reviewed.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nRegular publication of indices produced using prices scraped from supermarket websites; Late 2016\n\nImport.io potentially used as a monthly price collection tool; Early 2017\n\nReport on using WGSN data (web scraped from clothing retailers) to create price indices; Mid 2017\n\nRecommendations to Eurostat on use of web scraped data in UK consumer price indices; July 2017\n\nImplementation of improvements to rail fares; Early 2019\n\n####3.2.2 Developing an Index of Household Payments\n\n####Overview\n\nThe concept of an Index of Household Payments (IHP) was first proposed by Leyland and Astin (as the Household Inflation Index, HII), culminating in a paper^8^ submitted as a response to the 2015 consultation on consumer price statistics. Suggested differences from existing measures of price change include the potential inclusion of asset prices and interest payments, plus giving each household’s expenditure equal weight. Following the consultation the National Statistician decided that the IHP could serve as an important complement to the suite of consumer price indices. \n\nWe have conducted research into the concepts and issues raised by Astin and Leyland’s paper and, in August 2016, released a discussion paper^9^. We are currently considering responses to this paper, alongside the advice of our advisory panels, which will feed into the future development of the index.\n\n####Implementation\n\nConsider responses to the discussion paper; End 2016\n\nPublication outlining final decisions on the production of IHP; Mid 2017\n\nInitiate new collections; Mid 2017\n\nRelease experimental IHP index as part of a wider analysis of income, expenditure and price change; End 2017\n\n####3.2.3 Measures of income and price change as experienced by different household types\n\n#####Overview\n\nResearch published in 2014^10^ shows that different household groups can experience different rates of inflation. Following the 2015 consultation on consumer price statistics, the National Statistician reached the decision that ONS should produce comparable measures of income and price change for different household groups on an annual basis in one publication. The initial publication will take place in 2017. We will ensure that we engage fully with users to gain feedback that will shape the further development of the measures in line with user needs.\n\nThe research on the inflation rates experienced by different household groups is based on the same price data sourced from the CPI (and CPIH). The indices could be developed further by differentiating between different products purchased, producing specific prices indices for each household group. Household sub-groups will also be produced for the IHP work, and so this item will be co-ordinated with the previous one.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nAnnual publication of measures of income and price change as experienced by different household types, followed by gathering of user feedback; 2017\n\n####3.2.4 CPIH regaining its National Statistics status\n\n#####Overview\n\nCPIH is a measure of consumer price inflation including owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). CPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental data collected by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) for England, as well as comparable data collected by the Welsh government and Scottish government, are used in the calculation of OOH. In August 2014, the National Statistics status of CPIH was suspended due to shortcomings identified in the methodology used to produce the rental indices for OOH. Improvements were implemented in 2015 and the reassessment of CPIH as a National Statistic commenced in September 2015.\n\nThe CPIH assessment report was published on 3 March 2016^11^. The report includes a number of requirements that need to be implemented for CPIH to regain its status as a National Statistic. ONS reported to the UK Statistics Authority on 26th September 2016 on the actions that it has taken to address these requirements. ONS will be publishing the new CPIH supporting documentation in October 2016, which will be used over a period of time to monitor the behaviour of the index, and increase awareness and confidence in CPIH. We hope for CPIH to be awarded National Statistic status in the first half of 2017. \n\nAs part of the reassessment process, we have used the Authority’s Administrative Data Quality Assurance Toolkit^12^  to implement the required level of quality assurance for all sources of administrative data used in CPIH (and CPI). In particular this includes the administrative rental data sources used for OOH. Other publications will include a CPIH Compendium, which provides information for users on the rationale behind rental equivalence and the methodology used to construct it, a Users and Uses article, which details how the various measures of inflation are used and by whom and a quarterly article which compares the different approaches to measuring OOH costs. \n\nBefore CPIH regains its National Statistics status it will be subject to a formal period of close scrutiny before the regulation committee is asked to consider whether ONS has met the requirements and CPIH can be badged as a National Statistic. The National Statistician considers that, subject to regaining its National Statistic status, the CPIH should become the preferred measure of inflation and the focus of ONS commentary.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nEvidence submitted for the CPIH assessment report; September 2016\n\nPublication of CPIH supporting documentation; October 2017\n\nMonitoring period; Late 2016 to Mid 2017\n\nCPIH badged as a National Statistic; TBC\n\n####3.2.5 Inclusion of Council Tax in CPIH\n\n#####Overview\n\nFollowing the 2015 consultation on consumer price statistics, the National Statistician reached the decision that Council Tax (and domestic rates for Northern Ireland) should be included in CPIH and that this should take place with the 2017 basket update.\n\nConsumer price statistics are rarely revised. However, once CPIH has regained its status as a National Statistic, the back series will be revised to re-introduce CPIH on the best possible footing. \n\n#####Implementation\n\nInclusion of council tax in CPIH; March 2017\n\n####3.2.6 Develop a reconciliation between CPIH and RPI and review the existing methodology for reconciliation\n\n#####Overview\n\nWith the move towards making CPIH the preferred measure of inflation, we will develop a reconciliation between CPIH and RPI, and use the opportunity to review the reconciliation method used. We will seek the advice of the Advisory Panel on Consumer Prices – Technical and other expert users. \n\n#####Implementation\n\nReconciliation between CPIH and RPI published; Early 2018\n\nImproved reconciliation method; 2019\n\n####3.2.7 Addressing the formula effect\n\n#####Overview\n\nIn 2010, we made a number of changes to the methodology used to collect clothing prices. These changes meant that the gap between RPI and CPI, which use different formulae at the lowest level of aggregation^13^, widened. \n\nConstructing price indices for clothing items can be problematic. This is because the high product turnover associated with fashion items makes it difficult to identify comparable replacements. We will continue to explore the measurement of clothing prices through analysis of the web scraped clothing data provided by WGSN (see use of alternative data sources), as well as considering other ways that the measurement of clothing price changes could be improved. We will seek the advice of its advisory panels in this matter.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nReport on using WGSN data to create price indices; Mid 2017\n\nFurther research into clothing price indices; 2019\n\n###3.3 Medium priority items\n\nMedium priority items form an important part of the work programme but if necessary delivery may be delayed for high priority items. Medium priority items are listed in order of implementation (of the first deliverable).\n\n####3.3.1 Short-term European compliance issues\n\n#####Overview\n\nThe UK CPI is also the UK’s Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). The HICP is a measure of inflation produced by all EU member states in line with EU regulations. We are working to ensure compliance in a number of areas including:\n\n- introducing a lower level of aggregation, called COICOP5\n\n- implementing a temporal sample for fresh fruit and vegetables\n\n- addressing compliance issues related to the double chain link\n\nCOICOP5 (Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose) is a new level of disaggregation which sits below the class (or COICOP4) level indices already published. The need to introduce these changes into CPI is driven by the implementation of new European legislation. COICOP5 will be introduced in CPI and CPIH in March 2017.\n\nPrices for fresh fruit and vegetables are collected on a single Index Day, a Tuesday, in or around the middle of the month. To address temporal sampling requirements, a second collection day for fresh fruit and vegetables is in pilot. In 2016, the pilot was rolled out to a full collection with implementation in the CPI and CPIH in 2018, following a parallel run in 2017. The results and recommendations for implementation will be presented to the Advisory Panels for Consumer Prices in 2017 for consideration.\n\nThe CPI (and CPIH) uses a double chain link to introduce new class level weights in January, and new item level weights in February. Eurostat has been considering whether this approach is compliant with HICP regulations. An independent report written for Eurostat on this issue concluded that ONS should price-update weights twice a year to remove differences between the UK CPI and European HICP methodologies. In a meeting with Eurostat in December 2015 it was agreed that ONS would implement the recommendation for the HICP. As the UK CPI and HICP are one and the same the change will also apply to the CPI and CPIH.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nIntroduction of COICOP5; March 2017\n\nImplementation of price-updated weights twice a year; March 2017\n\nIntroduction of temporal sampling for fresh fruit and vegetables; Early 2018\n\n####3.3.2 Developing measures of accuracy for CPIH\n\n#####Overview\n\nDue to the complex survey design, calculating standard errors for CPIH and specifically the growth in CPIH is very challenging. \n\nThere are 2 dimensions to the sampling: selection of items and selection of outlets.  The sampling involves purposive sampling of both items and outlets. The CPIH weights come from a variety of sources. Some are administrative sources, some are survey-based. They are then put through national accounts balancing. This all makes the estimation of sampling errors difficult.\n\nAlso, CPI weights are price-updated using movements in the appropriate CPI index, so there is an interaction between weights and prices.  Annual rates of change in the price index are ratio estimates, usually over a chain link, so there may be correlations between prices in successive periods that need to be taken into account.\n\nEstimates of the variance due to the variance in the LCF data used as weights are currently being investigated. These will give an indication of some part of the accuracy of CPIH. \n\n#####Implementation\n\nSurvey methodology bulletin article on standard errors arising from expenditure weights; Quarter 2 2017\n\nFurther analysis and refinement; Quarter 1 2018\n\nEstimates of the sampling errors associated with central items; Quarter 3 2018\n\n####3.3.3 Monitoring of quality adjustment and quality change\n\n#####Overview\n\nOne of the more difficult issues in producing consumer price inflation statistics is the accurate measurement and treatment of quality change due to changing product specifications. The Johnson Review considered quality change and recommended ONS provides more information to explain how quality change is monitored. In response to the 2015 consultation on consumer price statistics some users suggested that ONS should devote more resources to improving and monitoring methods of quality adjustment. In particular the quality adjustment of services could be given more consideration. The Bean Review^14^ also considered quality change and found that the issue is likely to grow in importance with the “spreading tentacles of the digital revolution”.\n \nTo address these findings we will launch a project to review quality adjustment methods used in consumer price inflation statistics and provide more detail on how quality adjustment is monitored. \n\n#####Implementation\n\nReport on quality adjustment methods used and how quality adjustment is monitored; Late 2017\n\n####3.3.4 Improvements to CPIH methodology\n\n#####Overview\n\nThere are a number of ways in which the owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) component of CPIH could be further improved. We intend to explore these potential developments to further improve the effectiveness of CPIH as a measure of inflation. These are described in this section.\n\nWhen the OOH component in CPIH was developed in 2011 using administrative data sources for England, Wales and Scotland, comparable rental data for Northern Ireland were not suitable. At the time the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) received private rental data biannually, covering the Belfast Metropolitan Region only. As a result the existing CPI private rental data series for Northern Ireland has continued to be used. Since then the coverage across Northern Ireland has improved and the data are now available monthly. ONS has received an extract of these data from NIHE and started analysis with the ultimate aim of producing a rental index suitable for inclusion in OOH in 2018.\n\nCurrently, dwelling stock data from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) are used to mix- adjust rental data to reflect the OOH market. However, the property type split is not available on a regional basis, so the same property type split is applied across all regions. We will explore other potential sources of data to improve the stratification.\n\nThe Johnson Review^15^ identified that recent research into the measurement of rental equivalence has suggested using a flow measure (new lets only), rather than a stock measure (new and existing lets). We will also explore the appropriateness of using this new approach to measuring rental equivalence costs.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nNew rental data source for Northern Ireland implemented in OOH; Early 2018\n\nImproved property type split for stratum weights; 2018\n\nPresent findings from investigation into stock and flow measures of rental equivalence; 2019\n\n####3.3.5 Improvement to the transparency of CPI and CPIH\n\n#####Overview\n\nThe Johnson Review made 2 recommendations around transparency, specifically the review suggested that ONS provide more information to explain:\n\n- why prices for some items are sourced from the internet, while others are obtained from local shop-based collections^16^\n- what criteria are applied when deciding on the formula used to combine items at the lowest level of aggregation^17^\n\nTo address these recommendations we will review how these decisions are made and publish information on how this works in practice.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nImprovement to the transparency of CPI and CPIH; Mid 2018\n\n####3.3.6 Regional indices\n\n#####Overview\n\nRelative Regional Consumer Price Levels (RRCPL) are an example of a spatial price index which can be used to compare relative price levels to the UK for the 9 regions of England, as well as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. ONS published RRCPLs every 6 years using data collected to calculate Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Spatial Adjustment Factors (SAF). The next SAF collection is taking place in 2016 and the data may potentially be used to publish the RRCPL in 2017.\n\nThe regular collection of prices for consumer price inflation statistics is optimised for measuring inflation at the UK level. Prices are collected locally in 141 locations spread across Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the 9 regions of England. As a result, the number of locations visited per region is small, making the data less suitable for regional indices. Additionally, the prices for many products are collected centrally with no regional breakdown. The viability of using the existing price data to produce more geographically disaggregated price indices will be re-assessed.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nFeasibility report on the creation of regional breakdowns of consumer price indices; Mid 2018\n\n####3.3.7 Location boundary review\n\n#####Overview\n\nThe current sample frame used to select locations for the local price collection was drawn over 10 years ago. While the sample has been updated using rotation of locations and selection of outlets, the location boundaries need to be updated to reflect changing expenditure patterns.\n\nFour new locations boundaries are being piloted in 2016 and in 2017 and 2018 another 8 and 15 new location boundaries will be piloted respectively. Depending on feedback received from collectors in the field, the new boundaries could be rolled-out over a 5-year period starting in 2019. Advice will be sought from the Advisory Panels for Consumer Prices in 2018.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nRoll-out of new boundaries; January 2019\n\n###3.4 Low priority items\n\nThe delivery of low priority items may be delayed or even stopped to ensure the delivery of high and medium priority items. Low priority items are listed in order of implementation (of the first deliverable).\n\n####3.4.1 Discounts\n\n#####Overview\n\nRetailers are offering an increasing array of discounts to attract customers. Single product discounts (available to all consumers without conditions) are captured in consumer price statistics. However, many other types of discounts, such as multi-buy offers or loyalty schemes are excluded. The Johnson Review recognised the difficultly of accurately reflecting all discounts in consumer price statistics and recommended that ONS carry out more work in this area, ultimately seeking to reflect a wider range of discounts in its consumer prices statistics. \n\nIn 2017, we will pilot the collection of discounts data on items which are already collected locally. Field collectors will be asked to record information on discounts (including multibuy discounts) on the handheld devices. The pilot will be run on all food and drink items, with the facility to expand to other product groups in the future. The functionally on the handheld devices has been developed, and field testing is currently underway. In the interim, web scraped data is being used to explore the prevalence of discounts for the 3 supermarkets collected. \n\n#####Implementation\n\nPilot discount collection; January 2017\n\nAnalysis of discounts in web scraped data; 2017\n\nAnalysis of discount data collected locally; 2018\n\nImplement outcome of pilot; 2020\n\n####3.4.2 Weights\n\n#####Overview\n\nThe Johnson Review made a number of recommendations to improve the weights used in consumer price inflation statistics. In early 2014, we improved the commentary in the annual weights article to explain why weights differ and the publication was also brought forward to coincide with the implementation of the annual weights in the consumer price inflation publication. The review also recommended that ONS consider:\n\n- whether weights for some items should be based on more than one year of data to smooth irregular movements (and what causes those movements)^18^\n \n- whether the stratification of items by shop type can be improved^19^\n\nWe have developed a proposal to use a 3-year moving average to smooth the weights for 3 volatile items with irregular movement in the CPI and CPIH baskets. Insurance weights are currently based on 3 years’ data, although this is due to the insurance regulation rather than volatility. The Advisory Panel for Consumer Prices – Technical considered these proposals in May 2016, and we will be conducting more analysis.\n\nWe will also seek to introduce an appropriate stratification where weights for different types of shops are available and can be updated. \n\n#####Implementation\n\nFurther analysis on smoothing volatile weights in the CPI and CPIH; 2017\n\nUpdate shop type weights in the CPI and CPIH; Early 2018\n\n####3.4.3. Medium-term European compliance issues\n\n#####Overview\n\nThe UK CPI is also the UK’s Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). The HICP is a measure of inflation produced by all EU member states in line with EU regulations. We are working to ensure compliance in a number of areas. Specific items^20^ within CPI and CPIH which are being considered for improvement are:\n\n- package holidays\n\n- airfares\n\nIn 2015, Eurostat published the UK Compliance Report^21^ which stated that ONS’s method for package holiday collection is non-compliant. This is because price relatives for package holidays are calculated by comparing the price in the current month with the price the same month a year ago, rather than comparing the price with January. Additionally, in 2014, Eurostat made recommendations for the treatment of airfares and package holidays which highlighted several possible areas for improvement including last-minute deals, booking fees, treatment of seasonal items and booking methods.\n\nIn the UK, airfares are a particularly volatile index and we are investigating whether volatility due to one-off events, such as Easter and school holidays, could be better captured with a temporal collection of airfare prices. \n\n#####Implementation\n\nImplementation of improvements to airfares; Early 2018\n\nImplementation of improvement to package holidays; 2019\n\n####3.4.4 Develop alternatives to the use of RPI data\n\n#####Overview\n\nFollowing the 2015 consultation on consumer price statistics, the National Statistician decided that ONS would publish the bare minimum of RPI-related data necessary to ensure the critical and essential needs of existing users are met. To aid users in finding alternatives to the use of RPI data we will:\n\n- develop a new method for calculating average prices using CPIH\n\n- shift the long run (1750 onwards) inflation series from RPI to CPIH\n\n- update the personal inflation indicator (PIC) to CPIH\n\n- develop and publish a hierarchy of historical indices\n\n#####Implementation\n\nAlternatives developed to the use of RPI data; Mid 2018\n\n####3.4.5 Improvements to OOH(NA)\n\n#####Overview\n\nWe currently produce an experimental net acquisitions index for Eurostat, as part of a pilot to incorporate owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) costs into the HICP. Currently there is no weight for the component “existing dwellings new to the household” sector, which means that it is given a zero weight in the aggregation. Moreover, the weight for the “acquisition of new dwellings” component includes new dwellings outside the OOH sector (that is, the weight is gross acquisitions, rather than net). Wewill explore data sources that could be used to improve this experimental index.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nImproved methodology for the net acquisitions index; 2019\n\n####3.4.6 The extent to which consumers substitute between outlets\n\n#####Overview\n\nThe Johnson Review recommended that ONS should research the extent to which consumers substitute between outlets.

              "markdown": "The payments approach is an experimental method for measuring owner occupier housing (OOH) costs that attempts to capture what households pay out as owner occupiers when consuming housing (excluding capital repayments). This includes mortgage interest payments, transaction costs such as estate agency fees and legal fees, and running costs such as repairs and maintenance, ground rent and dwelling insurance.\n\nTable 2 presents a full list of the OOH(Payments) component indices, as well as the source data for the prices and weights information used to construct the index. Most of the indices are drawn from the Retail Prices Index (RPI), which can be said to follow a payments approach to measuring OOH. One of the problems for the payments approach is to account for major repairs and maintenance, which are difficult to obtain prices for on a consistent basis. One method of dealing with this problem is the approach taken in the RPI, which includes a component for the depreciation of the property. The approach was characterised as estimating the amount of money households should put aside for necessary major repairs and updating in order to maintain the value of the property. The method used here, which is more in line with a true payments approach, is to include a major repairs and maintenance component, proxied by the regular repairs and maintenance series in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) due to a lack of alternative data source.\n\nThe other sub-index which does not come from the RPI is the Stamp Duty index. This has been constructed for the OOH(NA) approach (see Annex 1B), and uses national accounts gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) and household final consumption expenditure (HHFCE) as the source data for the expenditure weights.\n\n<ons-table path=\"5dc5ec72\" />",

              "markdown": "The net acquisitions approach is an experimental method for measuring owner occupier housing (OOH) costs that are associated with the purchase and ongoing ownership of dwellings for own use. As the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) does not cover investment spending, the net acquisitions approach treats a home as the purchase of a good that is part asset (the land) and part consumable (the house) and excludes the land component from the index. OOH(NA) also includes costs associated with buying and maintaining a house; for example, self builds and renovations, repairs and maintenance, transfer costs and dwelling insurance. The method we use to calculate OOH(NA) was proposed by Eurostat. It groups sub-indices measuring different aspects of OOH costs into 2 classes; those related to the acquisition of dwellings and those related to the ownership of dwellings.\n\nThe ideal method for excluding the land component in OOH(NA) is the net/net approach, whereby prices and weights both exclude the land component from the house purchase. However, as many EU member states (including the UK) are unable to implement the net/net approach due to a lack of available data, Eurostat requires all member states to use the net/gross (net weight, gross price) approach. This includes the use of the House Price Index (HPI), which does not separate between the land and house price, within the “Acquisition of New Dwellings” and “Existing Dwellings New to the OOH Sector” components. This means that the net acquisitions approach presented here will include some measure of asset price in the index.\n\nIn addition to the HPI, Table 3 presents the other sources of component price indices. With the exception of the Stamp Duty Index, all are drawn from some of our existing publications, including the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI) and Retail Prices Index (RPI). For more information about each of the sub-indices, please see [Owner occupiers' housing costs using the net acquisitions approach][1] for a more detailed description.\n\nTable 3 also shows that the component expenditure weights used to compile OOH(NA) are derived from the national accounts gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) and household final consumption expenditure (HHFCE). The “net“ principle in net acquisitions relates to the fact that only transactions that occur between the OOH sector and other sectors (for example, construction firms and private landlords) should be included. However, we cannot currently distinguish between sectors and therefore the weight for “Acquisition of New Dwellings“ includes expenditure on all newly constructed dwellings and not those specifically destined for the OOH sector as per the methodology outlined by Eurostat. In addition, a weight for “Existing Dwellings New to the OOH Sector“ does not exist; therefore, a zero weight is currently applied.\n\n<ons-table path=\"7a749713\" />\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/owneroccupiershousingcostsusingthenetacquisitionsapproach",

              "markdown": "The rental equivalence approach is a method for measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) at the point at which the services provided by owner occupiers’ housing services are consumed. \n\nRental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. The rent charged by landlords covers not just the property but many of the other costs borne by owner occupiers, such as repairs and maintenance, and transaction costs. Therefore, under the rental equivalence approach, these are not estimated separately, as to do so would introduce double-counting. The rental equivalence approach also does not capture changes in asset value; rather it measures the change in price of housing services provided.\n\nThe rental equivalence approach uses private rental data from the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) and supplemented with data from the devolved administrations. The data are stratified regionally as well as by property type (detached, semi-detached, terraced or flat or maisonette) and whether the property is furnished or unfurnished. For each stratum, elementary aggregates are calculated which are then weighted together to create an aggregate index.\n\nThe private rental data are used in both the calculation of the owner occupiers’ housing costs component in CPIH (the rental equivalence approach) and the Index of Private Housing Rental Prices (IPHRP). The difference between the indices stems from the different weights used to combine the elementary aggregates. Strata weights for owner occupiers’ housing costs using the rental equivalence approach are designed to represent the owner occupied market and strata weights for IPHRP are designed to represent the private rental market. For example, looking at the range of housing available on the market, there would be a larger proportion of typical rental properties (for example, 1-bedroom flats), and the weights calculated would reflect this mix. By comparison, the owner occupied housing weights will reflect the larger proportion of more typically purchased properties (for example, 3-bedroom detached houses). Expenditure weights are calculated by multiplying dwelling stock counts for the owner occupied sector or private rental sector by average rental prices.\n\nFor a more detailed overview of the rental equivalence approach methodology, please see the [CPIH compendium][1]. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/cpihcompendium/2016-10-13",

This is distinct from the cost of purchasing a house. A consumer price index aims to measure consumption, whereas the purchase of a house is the purchase of an asset that is not consumed in the same way as other items. OOH costs are therefore challenging to measure. \nThere is not a single defined measure of OOH because they can be calculated differently depending on what the target is. In particular, should it be measured at the point of acquisition of the housing service, the point of use, or the point at which it is paid for? Each of these 3 approaches has its own specific methodological strengths and weaknesses and is measured using different methods. Determining which approach is most suitable for a given purpose and how best to measure it, is one of the most contentious issues in the field of inflation measurement. The reasons for this stem from both methodological and practical considerations.\n\nThis article is the first in a series that aims to provide more information about the different approaches to measuring OOH to aid your understanding of the differences in concept and underlying methodology. It will be updated on a quarterly basis to evaluate the performance of the different measures over time, in prevailing economic conditions. It will also include a new “spotlight” section each quarter that focuses on a particular topic relevant to the measurement of OOH. The first spotlight will look at the relationship between private rents and house prices. We invite you to submit ideas for future spotlights to <cpi@ons.gsi.gov.uk>. \n\nAs this is the first publication of this release, the focus will be more on the trends seen across the entire time period (2005 to 2016). It will therefore be a longer article than future releases, which will instead focus more on recent data.\n\nFor more information on the CPIH, please see the [CPIH compendium][1].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/cpihcompendium/2016-10-13",

              "markdown": "In constructing a measure of inflation, a decision must be made on the point at which to observe price change. There are 3 choices:\n\n- the point of acquisition of a good or service\n\n- the point at which it is used\n\n- the point at which it is paid for\n\nFor most goods and services, this makes little to no difference. For example, an apple would generally be acquired, paid for and used (eaten) in the same period (month). For a number of goods and services, it could make some difference. These differences are at their largest when considering owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). Owner occupiers’ housing is acquired at a single point, used for many years and can be paid for (for example, through a mortgage) over much of a lifetime. Statisticians and economists have developed theoretical methods to measure OOH from each of these perspectives; each method is summarised in Table 1.\n\n<ons-table path=\"aa046666\" />\n\nThis article presents a comparison of the rental equivalence, net acquisitions and the payments approach to calculating OOH. The narrow user cost method has not been developed because of the subjectivity involved in selecting the methodology for determining the real rate of interest, an important component in calculating the opportunity cost of home ownership. Both the net acquisitions approach and the payments approach are produced on an experimental basis.\n\n###Overview of the payments approach\n\nThe first measure discussed here is a payments approach to calculating owner occupiers housing costs – OOH(Payments). It is presented in this article as a comparison tool against the other approaches, but it has not been published previously. While the approach used to measure owner occupiers’ housing costs in the RPI is sometimes described as a payments approach, this is not strictly true as it includes a measure of depreciation and doesn’t include stamp duty as a transaction cost. \n\nFor the purposes of this article, the payments approach is aggregated together using the relevant components from RPI (including mortgage interest payments, transactions costs and running costs) in addition to indices that capture changes in payments of Stamp Duty and major repairs and maintenance. For more information about the methodology used to calculate the payments approach, please see Annex 1A for a summary.\n\n###Overview of the net acquisitions approach\n\nEurostat is currently exploring different ways of measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs for the European-wide Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). As part of this development work, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) is required by European regulations to produce an index using the net acquisitions approach – OOH(NA). The net acquisitions approach is preferred by Eurostat because it is the best measure to use to produce a consistent measure across all European countries. This is because the housing market is different across different countries: for example, in many countries there is no rental market, which means that the rental equivalence approach cannot be used. Moreover, the rental equivalence approach is not necessarily in line with HICP regulations, which forbids the use of imputation^1^.\n\nHowever, there are still a number of limitations with the net acquisitions approach. For instance, because of lack of available data in most European countries (including the UK), the methodology proposed does not separate between the land and house price, and therefore there will be some measure of asset price included in the index. This means it is not suitable as a measure of the cost of consumption. In addition, there is currently no available weighting information for one of the sub-components of the index and therefore a zero weight is applied. In summary, while this is the best measure of the net acquisitions approach that we can currently produce, this lack of available source data affects the reliability of the approach and it therefore should be treated with caution.\n\nThe net acquisitions approach presented here is consistent with the [measure that we currently produce for Eurostat][1], which can be found on our website. For more information about the methodology used to calculate the net acquisitions approach, please see Annex 1B for a summary, or the [full methodology article][2] for more information. \n\n###Overview of the rental equivalence approach\n\nThe final approach presented here, the rental equivalence approach – OOH(RE) – is consistent with the [measure of owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) used in the CPIH][3]. As the principle behind CPIH is to measure the average change in the prices of goods and services bought for the purpose of consumption by households, the appropriate measure of OOH in CPIH is rental equivalence, which captures the ongoing consumption of owner occupiers’ housing services. This is because the other approaches include either a measure of interest rates, or some measure of the capital element of housing, which make them unsuitable for a price index that measures the changing cost of consumption. The approach is also based on a higher quality data source than the other approaches presented in this article, allowing for a more reliable estimate of the measure. \n\nFor more information about why the rental equivalence is used in CPIH, please see the [CPIH compendium][4]. The compendium also contains further information about the methodology used to calculate the rental equivalence approach, or please see Annex 1C for a summary.\n\n####Notes for Different approaches of measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs:\n\n1.

              "markdown": "The payments approach aims to measure the payments related to the ownership of owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). This means that all payments that households make as owner occupiers when consuming housing should be included, such as mortgage interest payments, transaction costs such as estate agency fees and legal fees, and running costs such as repairs and maintenance, ground rent and dwelling insurance. As interest payments represent the cost of borrowing money rather than the cost of consumption, it would be inappropriate to measure OOH costs this way in CPIH. OOH(Payments) is an experimental series and we therefore advise using it with some caution. For more information on the methodology used to construct the OOH(Payments) approach, please see Annex 1A.\n\nFigure 1 presents the contributions to the quarterly growth rate of OOH(Payments) from the sub-indices used in its construction. Looking at contributions to growth is helpful to provide insight into the main drivers behind the year-on-year changes in the series. \n\nFor the payments approach, it is the sub-index for mortgage interest payments that appears to have the highest impact on the aggregate series. Prior to the economic downturn in 2008, mortgage interest payments contributed positively to the growth of OOH(Payments), which peaked in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2007. This can be explained by a growth in the Bank of England base rate from 3.5% in July 2003 to 5.75% in July 2007. As the economic downturn took hold and the Bank responded to the financial market shock, the base rate fell to a historic low of 0.5% in March 2009. The corresponding decline can be seen in the negative contributions from mortgage interest payments, which drive the fall in the OOH(Payments) annual growth rate in 2009. \n\nSince the beginning of 2010, OOH(Payments) have seen less volatile growth, largely due to the unchanged base rate set by the Bank. The reduction in Stamp Duty rates in December 2014 led to a fall in the overall OOH(Payments) approach in 2015.\n\nIn Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2016, OOH(Payments) grew by 1.3% compared with Quarter 2 2015.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"16faaf65\" />\n",

              "markdown": "The net acquisitions approach – OOH(NA) – theoretically treats a home as the purchase of a good that is part asset (the land) and part consumable (the house) and excludes the land component from the index. OOH(NA) should also include costs associated with buying and maintaining a house; for example, self-builds and renovations, repairs and maintenance, transfer costs and dwelling insurance. As discussed in section 3, while the measure presented here is the best measure of the net acquisitions approach that we can currently produce, the lack of available source data means that some components are not recorded fully and some measure of asset price will be included in the index. We therefore advise that OOH(NA) should be used and referred to with caution, and is therefore not suitable for purpose in CPIH. For more information on the methodology used to construct OOH(NA), please see Annex 1B.\n\nFigure 2 presents the contributions to the quarterly growth rate of OOH(NA) from the sub-indices used in its construction. New dwellings, other services related to the acquisition of dwellings, and major repair and maintenance explain most of the changes in the 12-month OOH(NA) price growth. The strong growth in the period leading up to the start of the economic downturn in 2008 is mainly driven by increases in the prices of new dwellings and other services related to the acquisition of dwellings. The input data for the new dwellings series is the ONS House Price Index (HPI), which saw strong growth in house prices leading up to the start of the economic downturn. This demonstrates one of the main limitations of the current method of measuring net acquisitions, which is that movements in the asset price are not excluded from the index and can therefore influence some of the main trends shown in the data.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"3f36d309\" />\n\nNew dwellings had a relatively strong negative contribution between Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2008 and Quarter 4 2009 mirrored by the other services related to the acquisition of dwellings. This was likely caused by shrinking demand for housing caused by the economic downturn which in turn affected both house prices and transfer costs. \n\nIn the period following the recovery, growth in OOH(NA) was again driven by new dwellings and other services related to the acquisition of dwellings. House prices fell again in the period 2010 to 2013, corresponding to the second dip in the series. Movements in asset prices are therefore an important driver of trends in the OOH(NA) series, which can be further demonstrated by the close relationship between the HPI and OOH(NA) index shown in Figure 3.\n\nIn Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2016, OOH(NA) grew by 3.4% compared with Quarter 2 2015. \n\n<ons-image path=\"555fc991\" />\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/housepriceindex/previousReleases",

Because of the methodology used to calculate the rental equivalence approach, it is not possible to present a contributions chart for this approach. This is mainly due to the fact that OOH(RE) is not constructed using a set of sub-indices that measure different concepts (maintenance costs, stamp duty and so on), but instead is aggregated from indices measuring the same concept across regions. However, we can still compare movements in OOH(RE) over time on a monthly basis. Figure 4 shows that in June 2016, OOH(RE) grew by 2.3% compared with the same period a year ago.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"4a364b8b\" />\n\nOOH(RE) grew at a steady rate up until the end of 2009. Following the economic downturn, prices then fell sharply reaching a minimum of negative 1.8% for the 12 month growth rate in April 2010. OOH(RE) then recovered, although growth remained below that experienced in the period prior to the downturn.

              "markdown": "Although there is not a single defined measure of owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) and each of the methods discussed prior measure different aspects of OOH, it is still useful to look at the 3 measures together to see how they differ over time.\n\nThe cumulative measure of all 3 approaches is presented in Figure 5. It suggests that since 2005, OOH(NA) has shown the strongest growth over the period. OOH(Payments) saw strong growth prior to the economic downturn due to the large positive contributions from the growth in mortgage interest payments (Figure 1). Of the 3 measures, it has also seen the largest fall since the economic downturn, again driven by the falling price of mortgage interest payments and has still not recovered its pre-downturn peak. \n\nOOH(RE) appears at a lag to the OOH(NA) and OOH(Payments) approaches for the peak and trough before and after the economic downturn. This lag is because OOH(RE) is a “stock” measure of rents. This means that it captures price information for the entire stock of rental properties, which includes existing contracted properties and properties that are new to the market. Therefore, the flow of new rents based on recent developments in house prices will only gradually influence its development because the stock of existing dwellings is so much larger. This also means that the relative peaks and troughs of OOH(RE) will be subdued relative to OOH(NA) because the large stock of contracted rental properties is likely to mute the impact of volatile house prices. \n\n<ons-image path=\"ed7a2bc9\" />\n\nThe lag for OOH(RE) is not a disadvantage to using the rental equivalence approach in the calculation of the owner occupiers’ housing costs component in CPIH. This is because the rental equivalence approach aims to measure the flow of housing services that are consumed each period (consistent with the principles that underlie the construction of CPIH) and therefore does not need to follow the trend of house prices. If consideration is required of house prices, the HPI should be used instead.\n\n",

              "markdown": "The rental equivalence approach measures the ongoing consumption of owner occupiers’ housing in CPIH. It uses rental prices as a proxy for the costs of housing services. The rental equivalence approach therefore answers the question: “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. In other words, we value housing services by looking at the cost of the next best alternative to home ownership, namely renting a property: “if I did not own a home, I would need to rent one”.\n\nTherefore, as the approach aims to measure the cost of housing services rather the asset value of the house, it should not be expected to move in line with house prices in the short-term. \n\nHowever, intuitively, changes in house prices can be thought of as an important influence for private rental prices over a longer period of time. It may therefore be reasonable to expect a longer-term relationship between movements in rents  (which feed through into the rental equivalence approach) and house prices. This spotlight therefore meets the user demand for some analysis that looks to investigate this assumption.\n\nThis spotlight will first look at the theory concerning the relationship between house prices and rents, before looking at some empirical evidence. This evidence stems from comparing the ONS [Index of Private Housing Rental Prices (IPHRP)][1] data and the [House Price Index (HPI)][2]. The IPHRP measures the change in the price of renting residential property from private landlords. The index measures both the change in price of newly advertised rental prices and the price changes experienced by existing tenancies. The IPHRP uses the same source data as the rental equivalence approach but it is weighted differently to account for the different mix of properties found in the rental and owner occupied sectors. For more information on how the IPHRP and the rental equivalence approach are constructed from the same source data, please see the [CPIH Compendium][3].\n\nIn economic theory, the value of an asset (in this case, the house price) moves in line with the value of the revenue it generates (in this case, the rents that can be charged to others using the property). However, in the short-term, the relationship between house prices and rents could depend on other, external, factors. For example, rent for a property is likely to be higher in relation to the house price when the interest rate is higher. This is because it becomes more costly to own a house (for example, because of the increase in mortgage interest payments) and therefore demand for renting will increase. This may cause the house price and rental income from a property to move in different directions in the short-term.\n\nGiven this discussion, it seems reasonable to expect there to be a relationship between indicators of rental prices and house prices in the long-term. Stronger (weaker) house prices are likely to raise (lower) the costs of capital for landlords and all else being equal they should feed into higher (lower) rents.\n\nFigure 6 presents the HPI and IPHRP series for England indexed to January 2005 and confirms that there is a broad, positive association between these series. While the IPHRP series does not show the same degree of price change as the HPI, it moves in broadly the same direction as the house price series, although with a noticeable lag.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"3fafbebe\" />\n\nThis lag in the rental price series is examined in more detail in Figure 7, which plots the growth of house prices (left-hand axis) and rents (right-hand axis) in England since January 2006. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"536e39be\" />\n\nThe lag in rental prices is because of the fact that the IPHRP is a “stock” measure of rents. This means that it captures price information for the entire stock of rental properties, which includes existing properties and properties that are new to the market. Therefore, the flow of new rents based on recent developments in house prices will only gradually influence its development because the stock of existing dwellings is so much larger. The HPI, by contrast, is a “flow” measure, capturing only the part of the housing market that is changing as newly marketed properties are bought and sold. For this reason, we would expect the HPI series to adjust more quickly to changes in the wider housing market than the IPHRP series.\n\nIn summary, the preceding discussion and analysis suggests that it is reasonable to expect there to be a relationship between house prices and private rents in the long-term. However, there can be short-term divergences between the 2 series which can occur due to a wide range of different factors.\n\nThese short-term fluctuations and the observed lag in rental prices do not have any implications for the use of the rental equivalence approach in measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs in CPIH. As discussed at the beginning of this spotlight, the rental equivalence approach measures the ongoing consumption of owner occupied housing services and therefore does not need to follow the trend of house prices because that is not what it is intended to measure.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/indexofprivatehousingrentalprices/latest\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/housepriceindex/latest\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/cpihcompendium/2016-10-13",

OOH are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. This is distinct from the cost of purchasing a house which is partly for the accumulation of wealth and partly for housing services.\n\nThere is not a single defined measure of OOH because they can be calculated differently depending on what the target is. In particular, should OOH be measured at the point of acquisition of the housing service, the point of use, or the point at which it is paid for?

This means that all payments that households make as owner occupiers when consuming housing should be included, such as mortgage interest payments, transaction costs, and running costs. The payments approach is not our favoured method to measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) in CPIH. This is because a consumer prices index aims to measure consumption, and interest payments represent the cost of borrowing money rather than the cost of consumption. \n\nOOH(Payments) is an experimental series, and we therefore advise using it with some caution. We are continuing to work on identifying possible improvements to the current methodology and data sources. Any changes to the index will be highlighted in future releases and we will update the methodology section and historical series accordingly. For more information on the current methodology and data sources used to construct the OOH(Payments) approach, please see Annex 1A.\n\n####Payments approach\n\nThe payments approach is calculated using the below model:\n\nPayments approach = Mortgage interest payments<br>\n                    + Council Tax (Great Britain)<br>\n                    + Northern Ireland rates<br>\n                    + Dwelling Insurance<br>\n                    + Ground rent<br>\n                    + Stamp duty<br>\n                    + Estate agent fees<br>\n                    + Home-buyers survey<br>\n                    + Major repairs and maintenance<br>\n                    + House conveyancing\n\nA correction has been made to OOH(Payments) since the previous release in December 2016. This was due to a small error when aggregating the sub-indices. The previous releases have all been updated to reflect this change.\n\n###Latest figure and long-term trend\t\n\nOwner occupiers’ housing costs compiled using the payments approach - OOH(Payments) - experienced growth of 0.3% in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2016 compared with Quarter 4 2015 (Figure 1). This fell from Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2016, but remains in line with historical trends. \n\nFigure 2 presents the contributions to the quarterly growth rate of OOH(Payments) from the sub-indices used in its construction. Looking at contributions to growth is helpful to provide insight into the main drivers behind the year-on-year changes in the series. The fall from Quarter 3 to Quarter 4 was largely driven by an increase in the negative contribution from mortgage interest rates, which remain the largest negative contributor. The drop in the Bank of England base rate to 0.25% in August 2016 may have contributed towards this. Council Tax was the highest positive contributor, which is in line with recent quarters.\n\nFor a longer time series of contributions, please see the [dataset][1] presented alongside this release.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"77b7505e\" />\n\n<ons-chart path=\"644839b2\" />\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcosts",

              "markdown": "###What is the net acquisitions approach?\n\nThe net acquisitions approach – OOH(NA) – theoretically treats a home as the purchase of a good that is part asset (the land) and part consumable (the house). Asset prices should not be included in a consumer price index (which measures the cost of consumption), as an asset is not consumed in the same way that goods and services are. Therefore, the land component should be excluded from the index. OOH(NA) also includes costs associated with buying and maintaining a house; for example, self-builds and renovations, repairs and maintenance, transfer costs and dwelling insurance. The “net” principle in net acquisitions relates to the fact that only transactions that occur between the OOH sector and other sectors (for example, construction firms and private landlords) should be included.\n\nIn practice, while the measure presented here is the best measure of the net acquisitions approach that we can currently produce, the lack of available source data means that some components are not recorded fully. For instance, because of the lack of available data, the methodology used does not separate between the land and house price, and therefore there will be some measure of asset price included in the example. We therefore advise that OOH(NA) should be used and referred to with caution, and it is consequently not our favoured approach of measuring OOH in CPIH. As with the OOH(Payments) approach, it is an experimental index and we will continue to work on improving the methodology and data sources used in the index. For more information on the methodology used to construct OOH(NA), please see Annex 1B.\n\n####Net acquisitions approach\n\nThe net acquisitions approach is calculated using the below model:\n\nNet acquisitions approach = Acquisition of new dwellings<br>\n\t\t+ Self builds and renovations<br>\n\t\t+ Existing dwellings new to the OOH sector<br>\n\t\t+ Services related to acquisition<br>\n\t\t+ Major repairs and maintenance <br>\n\t\t+ Insurance connected with the dwelling<br>\n\t\t+ Other services related to ownership of dwellings\n\n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe net acquisitions approach – OOH(NA) – grew by 2.0% in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2016 compared with Quarter 4 2015. This is lower than the 2.1% growth rate for Quarter 3 2016 but is still in line with historical trends (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 4 shows the contributions to quarter on corresponding quarter of previous year growth rate for OOH(NA). While new dwellings continued to be the main driver of the increase in OOH(NA), its contributions to the growth rate have halved since Quarter 2. The input data for the new dwellings series is the HPI, which has seen a fall in the 12-month growth rate since July 2016 although there was a slight upward tick in December 2016. This demonstrates one of the main limitations of the current method of measuring net acquisitions, which is that movements in the asset price are not excluded from the index and can therefore influence some of the main trends shown in the data.\n\nFor a longer time series of contributions, please see the [dataset][1] presented alongside this release.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"9be1f959\" />\n\n<ons-chart path=\"4ac8ad8b\" />\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcosts",

              "markdown": "###What is the rental equivalence approach?\n\nThe final section presents the rental equivalence approach to measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs – OOH(RE), which targets the measurement of ongoing consumption of OOH services, rather than when OOH is acquired or when it is paid for. As a consumer price index, CPIH is a measure of the cost of consumption. Therefore the choice of method for measuring OOH should be based on the most statistically accurate method for measuring the cost of consumption in the UK. This means that asset prices should not be included, as an asset is not consumed in the way that goods and services are. The rental equivalence approach is our preferred method for measuring OOH costs in CPIH because the other approaches include either a measure of interest rates, or some measure of the capital element of housing, which make them unsuitable for a price index that measures the changing cost of consumption. The approach is also based on a higher quality data source than the other approaches presented in this article, allowing for a more reliable estimate of the measure. For more information about why the rental equivalence is used in CPIH, please see the [CPIH compendium][1].\n\n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nOOH(RE) grew by 2.6% in December 2016 compared with December 2015 (Figure 5). This continued the upward trend in 12-month growth rate of OOH(RE) seen since the end of 2015 and began to reach similar levels of growth seen prior to the economic downturn in 2008. On a quarterly basis for consistency with OOH(Payments) and OOH(NA), OOH(RE) grew by 2.6% in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2016 compared with the corresponding quarter of the previous year, up from 2.4% in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2016.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"1b65978d\" />\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/qmis/consumerpriceinflationqmi",

              "markdown": "Although there is not a single defined measure of OOH, and each of the methods discussed prior measure different aspects of OOH, it is still useful to look at the 3 measures together to see how they differ over time.\n\nThe cumulative measure of all 3 approaches is presented in Figure 6. It suggests that since 2005, OOH(NA) has shown the strongest growth over the period. OOH(Payments) saw strong growth prior to the economic downturn due to the large positive contributions from the growth in mortgage interest payments (Figure 6). Of the 3 measures, it has also seen the largest fall since the economic downturn, again driven by the falling price of mortgage interest payments and has still not recovered its pre-downturn peak.\n\nOOH(RE) appears at a lag to the OOH(NA) and OOH(Payments) approaches for the peak and trough before and after the economic downturn. This lag is because OOH(RE) is a “stock” measure of rents. This means that it captures price information for the entire stock of rental properties, which includes existing contracted properties and properties that are new to the market. Therefore, the flow of new rents based on recent developments in house prices will only gradually influence its development because the stock of existing dwellings is so much larger. This also means that the relative peaks and troughs of OOH(RE) will be subdued relative to OOH(NA) because the large stock of contracted rental properties is likely to mute the impact of volatile house prices.\n\n<ons-image path=\"74aa0784\" />\n\nThe lag for OOH(RE) is not a disadvantage to using the rental equivalence approach in the calculation of the owner occupier’s housing costs component in CPIH. This is because the rental equivalence approach aims to measure the housing services that are consumed each period (consistent with the principles that underlie the construction of CPIH) and therefore does not need to follow the trend of house prices. If consideration is required of house prices, the HPI should be used instead.",

              "markdown": "To calculate CPIH, the owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) component measured using the rental equivalence approach is aggregated together with other items in the fixed basket of goods and services. Expenditure weights for the OOH component comes from the National Accounts household final consumption expenditure (HHFCE) data on imputed rentals. In turn, this is taken from the latest available national accounts dataset, which is published in Quarter 3, and is consistent with the most recent Blue Book release (typically published in June or September). Thus for a given year y, the expenditure shares are based on the Blue Book release y-1, which publishes data for year y-2.\n\nNational accounts estimates are open for revisions, and therefore there can be differences between the initial expenditure estimates used to calculate the OOH weights and revised expenditure totals for each year provided in subsequent Blue Book releases. This spotlight aims to provide an overview of the revisions that have affected the HHFCE imputed rentals series. This has also been summarised in the [CPIH Compendium Section 2.4.2][1]. For more information, please see the [Changes to National Accounts: Imputed Rental (2016)][2] article as well as [Blue Book 2013: Improvements to Household Expenditure Estimates][3].\n\nFigure 7 provides an overview of Blue Book consistent published expenditure for the HHFCE imputed rentals component. Each line represents a different vintage of Blue Book data and its respective historical series. For example, the line for Blue Book 2016 (BB2016) covers yearly expenditure from 2002 to 2015. The lines are grouped according to important changes to methodology and data sources. The red lines indicate vintages of Blue Book between 2004 and 2012. The blue lines are between 2013 and 2015, while the orange top line is consistent with Blue Book 2016.\n\nThe bars in Figure 7 represent the differences in total expenditure between the first publication of data for that year and the latest Blue Book vintage. Specifically, we divide the bars into changes from BB2004 to BB2012 (red), BB2012 to BB2015 (blue) and BB2015 to BB2016 (orange). These illustrate the different magnitudes of revisions implemented, in particular for Blue Book 2013 and Blue Book 2016.\n\n<ons-image path=\"9954e316\" />\n\n###Blue Book 2004 to Blue Book 2012 \n\nThe revisions to imputed rentals expenditure leading up to Blue Book 2012 (red bars) have not been large relative to subsequent revisions, and have mainly been due to minor data changes. The largest difference over this period was for 2004, which was revised upwards by 6% between Blue Book 2005 and Blue Book 2012. \n\n###Blue Book 2013 to Blue Book 2015 \n\nThe blue bars in Figure 7 show that there has been a noticeable level shift in total expenditure for imputed rentals from Blue Book 2012 to Blue Book 2013. This is due to expenditure revisions that occurred due to changes in the methodology. In particular, prior to the release of Blue Book 2013 there had been a large development project on the treatment of “Imputed rentals on owner-occupied dwellings” and “Maintenance and repairs of the dwelling”. The aim of these improvements was to ensure increased compliance with ESA95. The changes were implemented in Blue Book 2013 and involved changes to the treatment of imputed rentals on owner-occupied dwellings. The change ensured that maintenance and repairs expenditure was included within imputed rentals expenditure. \n\nThere were further changes to expenditure between Blue Book 2013 and Blue Book 2014. When CPIH was introduced in 2013, it showed a different evolution in prices for owner-occupiers’ compared to the implied deflator^1^ used in the National Accounts. An interim solution was implemented in Blue Book 2014, fixing the current price imputed rental series so that it grew in line with the slower-growing CPIH deflator. This improvement was implemented for 2010 onwards, as only this period was open for revision at the point of introduction. Although this improved the series for the most recent period, bringing it in line with CPIH, it also led to a discontinuity until an improved methodology was introduced in Blue Book 2016. This is what caused the jump between 2009 and 2010 in Figure 7 for the BB2014 and BB2015 series.\n\n###Blue Book 2016\n\nThe large expenditure shift between Blue Book 2015 and Blue Book 2016 in Figure 7 can be mostly attributed to data source changes and minor complementary methodological changes. Before Blue Book 2016, the existing estimates of imputed rental expenditures (current prices) were based on price information from the Living Costs and Food (LCF) survey and housing stock levels from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). A new approach was implemented in Blue Book 2016 that uses Valuation Office Agency (VOA) data together with similar data from the devolved administrations instead of the LCF price data^2^. The VOA and DCLG data are also forecast to the latest period (where data are not yet available) at the strata level using standard [ONS forecasting principles][4]. As well as data changes, some changes were made to the calculation of the imputed rental series due to more robust VOA data (see [article][5] and section 2.4 of the [CPIH compendium][6]).\n\nWhen creating weights for OOH in CPIH for 2015, an early, non-systematised estimate of the imputed rentals expenditure consistent with this new Blue Book 2016 methodology was provided to Prices by National Accounts. This was instead of using the Blue Book 2014 data, as is standard practice. The offline expenditure allowed for the 2015 OOH weights within CPIH to be created on the new Blue Book 2016 basis. As [improvements to the OOH index][7] were being introduced in CPIH, the weights for imputed rentals were also revised backwards to ensure that there was no significant step change (see [Changes to National Accounts: Imputed Rental article][8]). This allowed Prices to mitigate the level shift in the underlying expenditure that was expected to occur between Blue Book 2015 and 2016 expenditure estimates and would have affected the OOH weights in CPIH.\n\nIn 2016, the weights for OOH were calculated based on a new set of preliminary estimates of the Blue Book 2016 consistent expenditure. These were different to the ones provided in 2015. However, these expenditure estimates were only used for the creation of 2016 weights and were not revised backwards to take on board this new set of expenditure estimates.\n\nThese preliminary estimates from National Accounts were slightly different to the final expenditure figures published in Blue Book 2016. As part of a package of improvements being introduced to CPIH in March 2017, it was decided that the OOH weights should be revised to ensure that the expenditure underlying the OOH weights within CPIH were consistent with Blue Book 2016 and remove the use of the offline estimates provided by National Accounts. It would also ensure that the price updating procedure applied to the historical expenditure figures for OOH are the same as the one that will be applied going forward. Overall, this ensures that the expenditure data is as up to date as possible and that the methods used are consistent. For the impact of using the finalised figures from Blue Book 2016 please see “[Impact of inclusion of Council Tax and revised imputed rents on CPIH][9]”.\n\n###Summary\n\nFigure 8 summarises the timeline of these revisions. Orange circles indicate that there have been routine data revisions, blue circles indicate cases where there have been methodological changes, red circles highlight revisions to the CPIH weights and finally white circles denote other notable changes. \n\n<ons-image path=\"5e88ea68\" />\n\nIn summary, historical data revisions have not been large (as evidenced by the changes experienced up to Blue Book 2012); however, given that the methodology has been improved it is difficult to say what these data revisions will look like in the future. There are some further [methodological changes planned for Blue Book 2017][10], although these are small compared to recent movement. There are also no further methodological changes planned for imputed rentals. As such, revisions to national accounts data should be smaller than those shown in the blue and orange bars in Figure 7. We therefore do not expect to revise the expenditure weights for OOH in the foreseeable future.\n\n####Notes for: Spotlight: Revisions to OOH(RE) expenditure weights\n\n1. An implied deflator is a measure derived by dividing a current price expenditure series by the volume series. For more information on the implied deflator refer to this [article][11].\n\n2. These sources have much larger sample sizes than the LCF (for example, around 500,000 properties per year in the VOA data), and this also allows the use of an improved methodology using stratification. In contrast, the LCF data are based on around 400 households’ rental prices per quarter.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/cpihcompendium/2016-10-13#section-2-constructing-the-rental-equivalence-measure-of-ooh\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/changestonationalaccounts/imputedrental\n  [3]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171766_315500.pdf\n  [4]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/gss-methodology-series/ons-working-paper-series/index.html\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/changestonationalaccounts/imputedrental\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/cpihcompendium/2016-10-13\n  [7]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/improvements-to-the-measurement-of-owner-occupiers--housing-costs-and-private-housing-rental-prices/index.html\n  [8]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/revising-the-weight-of-owner-occupiers--housing-in-cpih/index.html\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/impactofinclusionofcounciltaxandrevisedimputedrentsoncpih/dec2016\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/nationalaccountsarticles/actualandimputedrentalbluebook2017\n  [11]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/mini-triennial-review-of-the-consumer-prices-index-and-retail-prices-index.pdf",

This includes mortgage interest payments, transaction costs such as estate agency fees and legal fees, and running costs such as repairs and maintenance, ground rent and dwelling insurance.\n\nTable A1 presents a full list of the OOH(Payments) component indices, as well as the source data for the prices and weights information used to construct the index. Most of the indices are drawn from the Retail Prices Index (RPI), which can be said to follow a payments approach to measuring OOH. One of the problems for the payments approach is to account for major repairs and maintenance, which are difficult to obtain prices for on a consistent basis. One method of dealing with this problem is the approach taken in the RPI, which includes a component for the depreciation of the property. The approach was characterised as estimating the amount of money households should put aside for necessary major repairs and updating in order to maintain the value of the property. The method used here, which is more in line with a true payments approach, is to include a major repairs and maintenance component, proxied by the regular repairs and maintenance series in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) due to lack of alternative data source.\n\nThe other sub-index which does not come from the RPI is the Stamp Duty Index. This has been constructed for the OOH(NA) approach (see Annex 1B), and uses national accounts gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) and household final consumption expenditure (HHFCE) as the source data for the expenditure weights. \n\n<ons-table path=\"375f9506\" />",

As the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) does not cover investment spending, the net acquisitions approach treats a home as the purchase of a good that is part asset (the land) and part consumable (the house) and excludes the land component from the index. OOH(NA) also includes costs associated with buying and maintaining a house; for example, self-builds and renovations, repairs and maintenance, transfer costs and dwelling insurance. The method we use to calculate OOH(NA) was proposed by Eurostat. It groups sub-indices measuring different aspects of OOH costs into 2 classes; those related to the acquisition of dwellings and those related to the ownership of dwellings.\n\nThe ideal method for excluding the land component in OOH(NA) is the net-net approach, whereby prices and weights both exclude the land component from the house purchase. However, as many member states (including the UK) are unable to implement the net-net approach due to a lack of available data, Eurostat requires all member states to use the net-gross (net weight, gross price) approach. This includes the use of the House Price Index (HPI), which does not separate between the land and house price, within the “Acquisition of New Dwellings” and “Existing Dwellings New to the OOH Sector” components. This means that the net acquisitions approach presented here will include some measure of asset price in the index.\n\nIn addition to the HPI, Table A2 presents the other sources of component price indices. With the exception of the Stamp Duty Index, all are drawn from some of our existing publications, including the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI) and Retail Prices Index (RPI). More information about each of the sub-indices is available.\n\nTable A2 also shows that the component expenditure weights used to compile OOH(NA) are derived from the national accounts gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) and household final consumption expenditure (HHFCE). The “net” principle in net acquisitions relates to the fact that only transactions that occur between the OOH sector and other sectors (for example, construction firms and private landlords) should be included. However, we cannot currently distinguish between sectors and therefore the weight for “Acquisition of New Dwellings” includes expenditure on all newly constructed dwellings and not those specifically destined for the OOH sector as per the methodology outlined by Eurostat. In addition, a weight for “Existing Dwellings New to the OOH Sector” does not exist; therefore, a 0 weight is currently applied. The “Other services related to ownership of dwellings” is based on the national accounts series 04.4.4 “Other services relating to the dwelling” and has zero expenditure recorded in Blue Book 2016. It therefore has a weight of 0 in the net acquisitions approach, and is excluded from the calculation.\n\n<ons-table path=\"e5a52e71\" />",

              "markdown": "The rental equivalence approach is a method for measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) at the point at which the services provided by OOH are consumed. \n\nRental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. The rent charged by landlords covers not just the property but many of the other costs borne by owner occupiers, such as repairs and maintenance and transaction costs. Therefore, under the rental equivalence approach, these are not estimated separately, as to do so would introduce double-counting. The rental equivalence approach also does not capture changes in asset value; rather it measures the change in price of housing services provided.\n\nThe rental equivalence approach uses private rental data from the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) and supplemented with data from the devolved administrations. The data are stratified regionally as well as by property type (detached, semi-detached, terraced, or flat or maisonette) and whether the property is furnished or unfurnished. For each stratum, elementary aggregates are calculated which are then weighted together to create an aggregate index.\n\nThe private rental data are used in both the calculation of the owner occupiers’ housing costs component in CPIH (the rental equivalence approach) and the Index of Private Housing Rental Prices (IPHRP). The difference between the indices stems from the different weights used to combine the elementary aggregates. Strata weights for OOH(RE) are designed to represent the owner-occupied market and strata weights for IPHRP are designed to represent the private rental market. For example, looking at the range of housing available on the market, there would be a larger proportion of typical rental properties (for example, 1-bedroom flats), and the weights calculated would reflect this mix. By comparison, the owner occupied housing weights will reflect the larger proportion of more typically purchased properties (for example, 3-bedroom detached houses). Expenditure weights are calculated by multiplying dwelling stock counts for the owner occupied sector or private rental sector by average rental prices.\n\nFor a more detailed overview of the rental equivalence approach methodology, please see the [CPIH compendium][1].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/cpihcompendium/2016-10-13",

To ensure that CPIH is of the best possible quality, the full back series of CPIH has been revised to incorporate council tax and revised weights for OOH using the rental equivalence approach. This means that the CPIH series published in the [dataset][2] alongside this release will be different to that published in the January article.\n\nThere are also changes to the CPI-H(Payments) and CPI-H(NA) series. To ensure coherence with the new CPIH series, CPI-H(NA) has been revised to include council tax. OOH(NA) remains the same. OOH(Payments) includes council tax and therefore it is already coherent with CPIH. The January article identified two methods of calculating the payments approach. We have since identified a correction in the OOH(Payments1) approach which has more closely aligned the two methods. From now on we will therefore only include the OOH(Payments1) method in the quarterly spreadsheet, and rename these series OOH(Payments) and CPI-H(Payments).\n\nFor reference, the formula used to calculate the aggregate indices for CPI-H(Payments) and CPI-H(NA) is as follows:\n\n<ons-equation path=\"bb5972f5\" />\n\n<ons-equation path=\"8dc3d181\" />\n\nWhere:\n\np is the price level<br>\nq is the volume purchased<br>\nr is the reference period<br>\nt is the time period<br>\ni is the items in the CPI basket<br>\nCT is council tax\n\nCPIH is as published.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcostsooh/weightsanalysis\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcostsoohweightsanalysis",

Central to this are the legally binding rules set forth in the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) and accompanying Manual on Government Deficit and Debt (MGDD). These include rules on classifying statistical units (organisations or bodies) and the transactions they engage in. A summary of these, and our approach to their application, can be found on our [economic statistics classification page][1].\n\nThis forward work plan sets out the units and transactions that we expect to assess and classify in the coming 12 months.\n\nThere is high demand for classification assessments and at any one time we are progressing a number of active cases. These include confidential assessments of government and devolved administration policy proposals (as explained in our [classification process][2]); we do not announce or discuss such policy proposal assessments as a matter of course in order to afford policymakers the space to develop policy. At such a time that a policy is implemented we will publish a classification decision.\n\nAs such, this forward work plan does not cover all cases which will arise over the coming year; furthermore, minor cases (with smaller statistical and policy impacts) will be assessed as resources allow. The cases scheduled below have been prioritised due to:\n\n- the significant impact they will have on important statistics (an impact of at least £1 billion on the government deficit or £10 billion on government debt)\n- their importance to public policy\n- their priority for Eurostat\n\nGiven all of the above, this work plan provides an up-to-date list of the cases we expect to classify over the coming year.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/economicstatisticsclassifications\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/economicstatisticsclassifications/ukeconomicstatisticssectorandtransactionclassificationstheclassificationprocess",

These are lump sum investments that earn a fixed rate of interest over set 1-year or 3-year terms. These bonds bear interest at above-market rates. We will establish how these bonds should be recorded in economic statistics.\n\n\tUpdate: completion was originally expected in April 2016. Due to resource issues and competing priorities the assessment is still ongoing but is expected to reach completion in January 2017.\n\n2.\t###Friendly societies\n\n\tCurrent classification: not yet classified\n\n\tReason for assessment: new detail required as part of ESA 2010 Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISH)/Household split\n\n\tPotential impact on fiscal aggregates: none\n\n\tPotential impact on national accounts: small\n\n\tExpected completion: March 2017\n\n\tFriendly societies are mutual organisations in the UK that provide financial services for their members. They offer members a wide range of affordable savings, investments, insurance, pensions and specialist annuities and provide other help when needed. This assessment will confirm the classification of such organisations in the context of the rules laid out in the ESA 2010 and whether they should be classified as NPISHs or as a different kind of unit.\n\n\tUpdate: completion was originally expected in August 2016. Due to resource issues and competing priorities the assessment is still ongoing but is expected to reach completion in March 2017.\n\n3.\t###Grants paid to Private Registered Providers of social housing in England\n\n\tCurrent treatment: capital transfers\n\n\tReason for assessment: to clarify the correct statistical recording of government payments to registered providers\n\n\tPotential impact on fiscal aggregates: medium\n\n\tPotential impact on national accounts: small\n\n\tExpected completion: within 12 months\n\n\tPrivate Registered Providers receive “grants” from the Homes and Communities Agency (central government body) to develop or purchase properties to be used for social housing.\n\n\tProviders fund their developments using a combination of commercially obtained loans or long-term bonds and the Social Housing Grant (SHG) or Housing Action Grant (HAG).\n\n\tIf a provider subsequently disposes of a property, the outstanding amount of SHG or HAG must either be reinvested into new affordable housing or repaid to the Homes and Communities Agency.\n\n\tUpdate: this assessment was included in the June 2016 forward work plan with completion brought forward to September 2016 from November 2016 so that it could be done alongside the assessment of Private Registered Providers of social housing in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Due to competing priorities the assessment is still ongoing.\n\n4.\t###Universities\n\n\tCurrent classification: almost all universities are classified as non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH); tuition fee payments (where relevant) are classified as transactions not at economically significant prices.\n\n\tReason for assessment: policy – significant increases in tuition fee maxima, and other changes in funding sources.\n\n\tPotential impact on fiscal aggregates: not applicable\n\n\tPotential impact on national accounts: medium\n\n\tExpected completion: within 12 months\n\n\tWe will review the classification of universities in the UK based on the 2010 European System of Accounts rules, in particular rules for assessing whether institutional units are ”market” or “non-market” producers.\n\n5.\t###Lifetime ISA\n\n\tCurrent classification: not classified\n\n\tReason for assessment: introduction of new government bonds\n\n\tPotential impact on fiscal aggregates: large\n\n\tPotential impact on national accounts: small\n\n\tExpected completion: within 12 months\n\n\tThe government, through the 2016 Budget has announced the introduction of new bank accounts that can be opened by 18- to 40-year-olds and will allow savers to contribute up to £4000 a year. The government will pay a 25% bonus on each pound paid into the accounts up to an annual cap of £1000 until the saver’s 50th birthday. We will establish how these payments should be recorded in economic statistics.\n\n\tUpdate: this assessment was included in the March 2016 forward work plan with completion expected in April 2016. However, it was found that there was insufficient detail available about the practical working of the scheme at that time and so the assessment will recommence once such detail becomes available; this is expected in 2017.\n\n6.\t###\"Minor\" trust ports\n\n\tCurrent classification: varies (central government, private non-financial corporations)\n\n\tReason for assessment: requests from units\n\n\tPotential impact on fiscal aggregates: small\n\n\tPotential impact on national accounts: small\n\n\tExpected completion: within 12 months\n\n\tTrust ports are independent statutory bodies each governed by their own, unique, statutes and controlled by a local independent board. In October 2013, we announced that \"major\" trust ports (those which exceed the revenue threshold set out under Section 11 of the Ports Act 1991 – £9.0 million in July 2012, with this threshold adjusted for Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation between periods), will continue to be treated as public corporations. This is because of the power of the relevant government sponsoring body to choose to enforce their sale (that is, privatisation) under Section 10 of the aforementioned Act and its right to a legally defined share of the proceeds from such a sale. \n\n\tAt the same time we undertook to consider trust ports with annual revenues below this threshold (\"minor\" trust ports) on a case-by-case basis. We have been contacted by a number of such trust ports requesting classification reviews. We plan to begin considering these cases in 2017, subject to the demands of higher-priority cases.\n\n7.\t###Pension Protection Fund\n\n\tCurrent classification: Public Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds (S.12501)\n\n\tReason for assessment: new rules in the 2014 Manual on Government Deficit and Debt (MGDD)\n\n\tPotential impact on fiscal aggregates: small\n\n\tPotential impact on national accounts: small\n\n\tExpected completion: within 12 months\n\n\tThe Pension Protection Fund was established to pay compensation to members of eligible defined benefit pension schemes, when there is a qualifying insolvency event in relation to the employer and where there are insufficient assets in the pension scheme to cover Pension Protection Fund levels of compensation. In the 2014 MGDD, new rules on the treatment of “protection funds” were introduced; we are reviewing the classification of the Pension Protection Fund in accordance with those rules.\n\n\tUpdate: this assessment was included in the December 2015 forward work plan with completion expected in March 2016. However, in order to complete this assessment, input is awaited from Eurostat on a separate case which will provide clarity on the correct interpretation of the new rules around protection funds in the MGDD.\n \n8.\t###Energy Companies' Obligation (ECO)\n\n\tCurrent classification: not classified\n\n\tReason for assessment: policy, developing rules from Eurostat\n\n\tPotential impact on fiscal aggregates: not known\n\n\tPotential impact on national accounts: not known\n\n\tOther impacts: statistics on taxation\n\n\tExpected completion: within 12 months\n\n\tECO was introduced in 2013 as a package of measures aimed at helping to improve the environmental efficiency of UK residential buildings. It requires large energy providers to offer financial support for efficiency measures such as improving insulation or installing a new boiler. It also requires companies to provide assistance to low-income and vulnerable households.\n\n\tThe international guidelines on treatment for such schemes are unclear and this has been discussed on several occasions internationally. The issue is that, while in the real world financial transactions flow directly from energy providers to consumers, these redistributive transactions would not occur without government impetus. One view is that such flows should be routed via government from energy firms to consumers, to reflect the tax-like nature of the situation. The re-routing of flows to reveal the economic reality of the transactions is an accepted practice in the European System of Accounts.\n\n\tHowever, there is international variation in the treatment of such transactions and this impacts the comparability of statistics on the tax burden in different countries.\n\n\tUpdate: in March 2016, Eurostat published a new version of the MGDD which included a new section with guidance on some situations where transactions should be rerouted. These are not readily applicable to UK schemes such as ECO but Eurostat has committed to further work to provide guidance on other situations where transactions should be rerouted. As such, we need to await the outcome of this work.\n",

The report assesses consumer price inflation statistics against standard dimensions of quality such as relevance, accuracy and accessibility. The report was last updated in October 2013.\n\n\tThe [mini Triennial Review (1.75 Mb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/triennial-reviews/triennial-review-of-the-consumer-prices-index-and-retail-prices-index-central-collection-of-prices-2012.pdf  \"Triennial Review of the Consumer Prices Index and Retail Prices Index central collection of prices 2012\") of the CPI and RPI Central Collection of Prices is available. \n\n\tThe most efficient way to access the latest consumer price inflation data and briefing on our website is via the CPI key figure on the [homepage](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html \"ONS Homepage\").\n\n\tIn response to user feedback, all consumer price inflation data are available in 1 location.

Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. The data published covers January 1996 to December 2014. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the May CPI is published on 16 June 2015, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to March 2015.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each Member State of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of March 2015 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 17 April 2015. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/international/eurostat-s-data-tables.html \"Eurostat's Data Tables\"). Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/hicp/overview \"Eurostat's HICP webpage\"). \n\n3. **Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation**\n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services (139.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi-basket-of-goods-and-services/cpi-2015-basket-of-goods.pdf \"CPI 2015 Basket of Goods\") . The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights (431.9 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi--updating-weights/2015.pdf \"2015\") .\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices, which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables (2.22 Mb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/march-2015/consumer-price-inflation-reference-table.xls \"Consumer Price Inflation Reference Table\") . By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the  [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/consumer-price-indices-technical-manual--2014.pdf \"Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual, 2014\") .

The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n5. **Publication policy**\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the March 2015 data, collected on and around 17 March 2015. Future [publication dates](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/publication-dates/index.html \"Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and Retail Prices Index (RPI) publication dates\") for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2017 (the publication of the December 2016 inflation figures). Publication dates from February 2016 onwards are provisional.\n\n\tDetails of the policy governing the release of new data are available from the Media Relations Office.

The Governor shared this information with the MPC, and officials present at the MPC meeting, on Wednesday 8 April 2015. The pre-release access to the March CPI figures was extended to 4 working days from 3.5 working days due to the timing of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting being moved forward half a day.\n\n\tConsumer price inflation for April 2014 to April 2015 will be published on 19 May 2015.\n\n\tFollow us on [Twitter](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/social-media/twitter.html \"Twitter\") or join us at [Facebook](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/social-media/index.html \"Facebook\").

Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWIIzIw45Do \"Video\") and an [infographic](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/infographics/how-cpi-is-calculated/index.html \"INFO CPI calculated\") explain how consumer price inflation is calculated.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to March 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between March 2014 and March 2015.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/users-and-uses-of-the-consumer-price-inflation-statistics.pdf \"Users and uses of the consumer price inflation statistics\") .\n\n### Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between March 2014 and March 2015 stood at 0.0%. This is the joint lowest 12-month rate on record alongside the rate in February 2015.\n\nOver the last 5 years, the 3 main contributors to the 12-month inflation rate have been: transport (including motor fuels); housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; and restaurants and hotels. Combined, these 3 sectors have, on average, accounted for around half of the 12-month inflation rate.\n\nIn the year to March 2015, food prices fell by 3.2% and prices of motor fuels fell by 13.7%. In both cases, the falls were smaller than in the year to February but the 2 groups still provided the largest downward contributions to the 12-month rate for March. In total, the food and motor fuels groups reduced the CPI 12-month rate by approximately 0.8 percentage points. An article was published in November 2014 which outlined some [possible factors that may be affecting prices (477.2 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/what-is-affecting-prices-in-the-uk-in-2014-.pdf \"What is affecting prices in the UK in 2014?\") .\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in March 2015 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.

The 1-month movement was therefore the same in both years and this led to the CPI 12-month rate remaining at 0.0% for a second month.\n\nThe largest downward contributions to change in the CPI 12-month rate between February and March 2015 came from:\n\n- **clothing and footwear:** prices, overall, fell by 0.1% between February and March this year, compared with a rise of 1.8% between the same 2 months a year ago. This is the first time that prices have fallen between February and March since the CPI was introduced. Normally prices rise as they continue to recover following the January sales period. The downward contribution came from price movements for a range of women’s outerwear, particularly trousers, dresses and cardigans. There was also a smaller downward effect from men’s outerwear.\n\n- **housing and household services:** prices, overall, fell by 0.4% between February and March 2015 compared with a smaller fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. The downward effect came from changes in gas prices, with average bills falling by more this year than a year ago.\n\n- **restaurants and hotels:** prices, overall, rose by 0.2% between February and March this year compared with a larger rise of 0.5% a year ago.\n\nThe largest upward contributions to change in the CPI 12-month rate between February and March 2015 came from:\n\n- **transport:** prices, overall, rose by 0.7% between February and March 2015 but were little changed between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward contribution came principally from motor fuels. Average petrol prices rose by 3.8 pence per litre between February and March this year compared with no change between the same 2 months a year ago. Diesel prices also rose this year by 3.5 pence per litre but fell by 0.4 pence per litre a year ago.\n\n- **food and non-alcoholic beverages:** prices, overall, fell by 0.2% between February and March 2015, compared with a larger fall of 0.5% between the same 2 months a year earlier. Small upward effects came from 4 product groups: milk, cheese and eggs; vegetables; sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery; and mineral waters, soft drinks and juices. These were partially offset by small downward contributions from meat and fruit.\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.

Further information on the changes is available in 2 articles: [Improvements to the measurement of Owner Occupiers’ Housing Costs and Private Housing Rental Prices (2.48 Mb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/improvements-to-the-measurement-of-owner-occupiers--housing.pdf \"Improvements to the measurement of owner occupiers' housing\") and [Revising the weight of Owner Occupiers’ Housing in CPIH (197.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/revising-the-weight-of-owner-occupiers--housing-in-cpih.pdf \"Revising thr weight of Owner Occupiers' Housing in CPIH\")** . \n\nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index. CPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn March 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between March 2014 and March 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.3%, unchanged from February. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in March 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in February, despite a small upward contribution from rising owner occupiers’ housing costs.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn March 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.3%, down from 0.4% in the year to February 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for March 2015 stood at 0.9%, meaning that it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period, the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 35.0% over the 10-year period, compared with 28.0% as measured by RPIJ. The use of the Carli formula has therefore added 7.0 percentage points to the change in prices over the last 10 years.

The consultation follows [a recent review of consumer price statistics](http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/current-reviews/range-of-prices-statistics.html \"UK Consumer Price Statistics: A Review\") led by Mr Paul Johnson (Director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies) and seeks users' views on the issues raised in that review. During the consultation period, the Authority will be hosting a series of consultation events across the UK beginning in London on 24 June. After the consultation closes on 15 September, the Authority will summarise the responses and publish a report.\n\n\tOn 11 June, we published historic estimates of [CPIH covering the period 1988 to 2004](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/cpih-historical-series--1988---2004-/index.html \"CPIH historical series (1988 - 2004)\") based on existing CPI data. Due to data limitations, these estimates do not form part of the official back series, but provide users with a best available estimate of CPIH for this period.\n\n\tOn 8 June, we published [trial consumer price indices](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/experimental-consumer-price-indices-using-web-scraped-data/index.html \"Trial consumer price indices using web scraped data\") constructed purely from price quotes that have been scraped from the web.  Web scraping is a tool for extracting information from the underlying HTML code of websites. We have been conducting research into these technologies and, since April 2014, have been scraping daily prices from the websites of three major retailers. The indices cover 35 grocery and alcohol items, and are presented at daily, weekly, fortnightly and monthly frequencies. The indices are accompanied by an explanatory methodological note and a brief overview of the project. \n\n2. **Understanding and accessing the data**\n\n\tA full description of how consumer price indices are compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/consumer-price-indices-technical-manual--2014.pdf \"Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual, 2014\") .

Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. Previously the data published covered January 1996 to December 2014. The data for January to March 2015 are also now available. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the August CPI is published on 15 September 2015, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to June 2015.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each Member State of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU Member States. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of May 2015 for EU Member States, together with an EU average, on 17 June 2015. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/international/eurostat-s-data-tables.html \"Eurostat's Data Tables\"). Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU Member States is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/hicp/overview \"Eurostat HICP\"). \n\n3. **Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation**\n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services (139.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi-basket-of-goods-and-services/cpi-2015-basket-of-goods.pdf \"CPI 2015 Basket of Goods\") . The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights (431.9 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi--updating-weights/2015.pdf \"Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights\") .\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables (2.49 Mb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/may-2015/ref-table-cpi.xls \"REF Table CPI\") . By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/consumer-price-indices-technical-manual--2014.pdf \"Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual, 2014\") .

Revisions policy\n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, a [revisions policy (49.6 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/consumer-price-inflation-revisions-policy-october-2013.pdf \"Consumer Price Inflation Revisions Policy October 2013\")  was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published. \n\n5. **Publication policy**\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the May 2015 data, collected on and around 12 May 2015. Future [publication dates](http://wasppreview.ons.statistics.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/publication-dates/index.html \"Publication dates\") for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2017 (the publication of the December 2016 inflation figures). Publication dates from February 2016 onwards are provisional.\n\n\tDetails of the policy governing the release of new data are available from the Media Relations Office.

Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWIIzIw45Do \"YouTube video\") and an [infographic](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/infographics/how-cpi-is-calculated/index.html \"How is the Consumer Prices Index calculated?\") explain how consumer price inflation is calculated.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to May 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between May 2014 and May 2015.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets.

This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in May 2014 would have cost £100.10 in May 2015. This continues the trend of the latest few months when inflation has been around 0.0%.\n\nIn the year to May 2015, food prices fell by 1.8% and prices of motor fuels fell by 11.0%. In both cases, the falls are smaller than in the year to April but along with audio-visual and related equipment they provided the largest downward contributions to the 12-month rate for May. In total, the food and motor fuels groups reduced the CPI 12-month rate by approximately 0.5 percentage points. An article was published in November 2014 which outlined some [possible factors that may be affecting prices (477.2 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/what-is-affecting-prices-in-the-uk-in-2014-.pdf \"What is affecting prices in the UK in 2014?\").\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in May 2015 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.

The 1-month movement was therefore 0.3 percentage points higher this year compared with a year ago, resulting in a rise in the CPI 12-month rate. The difference between the movements in the annual and monthly rates is due to rounding.\n\nThe largest upward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between April and May 2015 came from:\n\n- **transport:** prices, overall, rose by 0.6% between April and May 2015, compared with a fall of 0.7% a year earlier. The majority of the upward contribution came from transport services, particularly air transport where fares rose this year but fell a year ago. Changes in fares between April and May vary notably year on year, with the timing of Easter a likely factor in the movements. There was also a significant upward effect from motor fuels with average petrol prices rising by 2.5 pence per litre between April and May this year compared with a smaller rise of 0.4 pence per litre a year earlier. Diesel prices also rose this year, by 1.5 pence per litre, compared with a rise of 0.3 pence per litre a year ago. \n\n- **food and non-alcoholic beverages:** prices, overall, fell slightly by 0.1% between April and May this year but by a larger 1.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward effect came from a variety of product groups, most notably vegetables, bread and cereals, and sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery. \n\nThere was a smaller upward contribution from price movements for clothing and footwear where prices rose this year but fell a year ago, particularly for women’s outerwear.\n\nThe largest downward contribution to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between April and May 2015 came from:\n\n- **recreation and culture:** prices, overall, fell by 0.1% between April and May 2015, compared with a rise of 0.4% between the same 2 months a year ago. The downward effects came principally from games, toys and hobbies (notably computer games) and data processing equipment (principally computer peripherals such as printers and routers).\n\nThere was a smaller downward contribution from price movements for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, particularly wine.\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.

These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn May 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between May 2014 and May 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.4%, up from 0.2% in April 2015. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in May 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in April, despite a small downward contribution from owner occupiers’ housing costs.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the official CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ\n\nIn May 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.4%, up from 0.3% in the year to April 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for May 2015 stood at 1.0%, meaning that it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 34.6% over the 10-year period, compared with 27.7% as measured by RPIJ. The use of the Carli formula has therefore added 6.9 percentage points to the change in prices over the last 10 years.

This article explains the difference in growth between ONS private rental price indices and average private rental prices published by the Valuation Office Agency, both of which are based on the same underlying data. The private rental price indices are used for the private rental component in the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The indices are also used to calculate owner occupiers' housing costs in CPIH\n\n\t**Update on research into web scraping price data**\n\n\tOn 1 September 2015, the article and dataset [Research indices using web scraped data][2] was published. This analysed different ways of compiling price indices using scraped data and updated the [previously published web scraped data (611.7 Kb ZIP)][3] to include data for May and June 2015\n\n\t**Consultation on consumer price statistics**\n\n\tThe UK Statistics Authority launched a [public consultation][4] on consumer price statistics on 15 June. The consultation follows [a review of consumer price statistics][5] led by Mr Paul Johnson (Director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies) and seeks users' views on the issues raised in that review. After the consultation closes on 15 September, the Authority will summarise the responses and publish a report\n\n2. **Understanding and accessing the data**\n\n\tA full description of how consumer price indices are compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)][6]. This is supplemented by infographics and textual information available from the [guidance and methodology][7] section of our website\n\n\tA more detailed [quality report (141.9 Kb Pdf)][8] for this statistical bulletin is available. The report assesses consumer price inflation statistics against standard dimensions of quality such as relevance, accuracy and accessibility. The report was last updated in October 2013\n\n\tThe [mini Triennial Review (1.75 Mb Pdf)][9] of the CPI and RPI Central Collection of Prices is available\n\n\tThe most efficient way to access the latest consumer price inflation data and briefing on our website is via the CPI key figure on the [homepage][10].\n\n\tIn response to user feedback, all consumer price inflation data are available in 1 location. The [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][11] are provided via an Excel file.\n\n\tTo help users further, very detailed CPI data are now available including the [individual price quotes and item indices][12] that underpin the CPI. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. Previously the data published covered January 1996 to March 2015. The data for April to June 2015 are also now available. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the November CPI is published on 15 December 2015, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to September 2015.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each member state of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of August 2015 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 16 September 2015. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables][13]. Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][14].\n\n3. **Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation**\n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services (139.4 Kb Pdf)][15]. The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights (431.9 Kb Pdf)][16].\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][17]. By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)][18]. [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][19] provides further details of how consumer price statistics are used more generally.\n\n4. **Revisions policy**\n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, a [revisions policy (49.6 Kb Pdf)][20] was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n5. **Publication policy**\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the August 2015 data, collected on and around 11 August 2015. Future [publication dates][21] for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2018 (the publication of the December 2017 inflation figures). Publication dates from February 2017 onwards are provisional.\n\n\tDetails of the policy governing the release of new data are available from our Media Relations Office. Also available is a list of the names of those given [pre-release access][22] to the contents of this release.\n\n\tIn line with the Consumer Price Inflation Pre-Release arrangements, an advanced estimate of the CPI was provided to the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer 4 working days ahead of publication. The Governor shared this information with the MPC, and officials present at the MPC meeting, on Wednesday 9 September 2015. The pre-release access to the August CPI figures was extended to 4 working days from 3.5 working days due to the timing of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting being moved forward half a day.\n\n\tConsumer price inflation for September 2014 to September 2015 will be published on 13 October 2015.\n\n\tFollow us on [Twitter][23] or join us at [Facebook][24].\n\n\tMedia contact: <br>\n\tTel:  Luke Croydon   + 44 (0) 845 6041858 <br>\n\tOut of hours media line   + 44 (0) 7867 906553 <br>\n\tEmail:  <media.relations@ons.gsi.gov.uk>\n\n\tConsumer Price Inflation recorded message (available after 9.45am on release day): <br>\n\tTel: + 44 (0) 800 0113703\n\n\tConsumer Price Inflation Enquiries: <br>\n\tTel: + 44 (0) 1633 456900\n\n6.

Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. An [infographic][1] explains how consumer price inflation is calculated. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to August 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between August 2014 and August 2015.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

              "markdown": "###What is the CPI?\n\nThe CPI is a measure of consumer price inflation produced to international standards and in line with European regulations. First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf).][1]\n\n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between August 2014 and August 2015 stood at 0.0%. This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in August 2014 would have still cost £100.00 in August 2015. This continues the trend of the previous 6 months when inflation had been at or around 0.0%.\n\nIn the year to August 2015, food prices fell by 2.8% and prices of motor fuels fell by 12.9%. These 2 groups have provided some of the largest downward contributions to the 12-month rate during 2015. In August 2015, the food and motor fuels groups in total reduced the CPI 12-month rate by approximately 0.7 percentage points. Historically, price movements for these products have been among the main causes of inflation. An article was published in November 2014 which outlined some [possible factors that may be affecting prices (477.2 Kb Pdf)][2].\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in August 2015 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.

An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. [Explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (37.1 Kb Pdf)][3] is a diagram explaining the calculation.\n\nThe CPI rose by 0.2% between July and August 2015 compared with a larger rise of 0.4% between the same 2 months a year earlier. The 1-month movement was therefore 0.2 percentage points lower this year compared with a year ago, resulting in a fall in the CPI 12-month rate. The difference between the movements in the annual and monthly rates is due to rounding.\n\nThe largest downward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between July and August 2015 came from:\n\n- **transport**: prices, overall, rose by 0.1% between July and August this year compared with a larger rise of 0.8% between the same 2 months a year ago. Within transport, the largest downward contribution came from motor fuels, with diesel prices falling by 6.2 pence per litre this year compared with a fall of 2.1 pence per litre a year ago. Petrol prices also fell this year, by 2.4 pence per litre compared with a fall of 1.8 pence per litre a year ago. There was a large downward contribution from sea transport, with fares rising by less than a year ago. These effects were partially offset by a small upward contribution from air fares, which rose by more than a year ago, particularly on long-haul routes.\n\n- **clothing and footwear**: prices, overall, rose by 1.5% between July and August this year compared with a rise of 2.6% between the same 2 months a year ago. Prices of clothing and footwear usually rise between July and August as autumn ranges start to enter the shops following the summer sales season. The smaller rise this year follows a sales period in which prices fell by less than a year ago. The downward contribution came from price movements across a range of garments but particularly from women’s outerwear.\n\n- **recreation and culture**: prices, overall, fell by 0.4% between July and August this year compared with a fall of 0.1% a year ago. The downward contribution came from a range of sectors, most notably books and cultural services.\n\nThe largest upward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between July and August 2015 came from:\n\n- **furniture, household equipment and maintenance**: prices, overall, rose by 1.7% between July and August this year compared with a rise of 1.0% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward effect came principally from price rises for furniture and furnishings.\n\n- **food and non-alcoholic beverages**: prices, overall, were little changed between July and August this year compared with a fall of 0.2% a year ago. The upward contribution came from price movements for mineral waters, soft drinks and juices and, to a lesser extent, milk, cheese and eggs. These were partially offset by downward effects from bread and cereals, and meat.\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.

[Full details][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website and in an [explanatory note (313.9 Kb Pdf)][2] on our website. The improvements from the resulting development work were introduced as part of the February 2015 dataset with the historical series revised back to 2005. Further information on the changes is available in 2 articles: [Improvements to the measurement of Owner Occupiers’ Housing Costs and Private Housing Rental Prices (2.48 Mb Pdf)][3]  and [Revising the weight of Owner Occupiers’ Housing in CPIH (197.4 Kb Pdf).][4]**\n\nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn August 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between August 2014 and August 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.3%, down from 0.4% in July 2015. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in August 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in July. Owner occupiers’ housing costs increased by 0.2% between July and August 2015, the same as between these months a year earlier. This meant it had a negligible impact on the change in the CPIH 12-month rate between the 2 months.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the official CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn August 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.5%, up from 0.4% in the year to July 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for August 2015 stood at 1.1%, meaning that it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 34.9% over the 10-year period, compared with 27.8% as measured by RPIJ. The use of the Carli formula has therefore added 7.1 percentage points to the change in prices over the last 10 years. A larger version of the chart can be viewed by clicking on it (HTML version only).\n\nTable C shows the RPI and RPIJ 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/2015-09-15/6b5ae1dd\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/2015-09-15/987e3847\" />\n\nFor users who want to understand the causes of the difference between the CPI and RPI, please see Table 5 in the Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables of the August 2015 release.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/assessment/assessment-reports/assessment-report-246---the-retail-prices-index.pdf \"full assessment report\"\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/users-and-uses-of-the-consumer-price-inflation-statistics.pdf \"Users and uses of the consumer price inflation statistics\"",

We are currently going through the responses to summarise the views raised. This will be published in a response to the consultation by early December. The Authority Board will consider these responses carefully before issuing its final response in the first part of 2016.\n\n\t**Development of a single, official house price index – progress update** \n\n\tWe are working with a number of other Government departments to develop a single official house price index that makes best use of relevant data sources across the public sector. An update on progress is included in our latest [House Price Index bulletin](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/hpi/house-price-index/august-2015/stb-hpi-august-2015.html \"House Price Index\").\n\n2. **Understanding and accessing the data** \n\n\tA full description of how consumer price indices are compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/consumer-price-indices-technical-manual--2014.pdf \"Consumer Prime Indices Technical Manual, 2014\"). This is supplemented by infographics and textual information available from the [guidance and methodology section](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/economy/consumer-price-indices/index.html \"Consumer Price Indices\") of our website.\n\n\tA more detailed [quality report (141.9 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/quality-information/economic-statistics/summary-quality-report-for-cpi.pdf \"Summary quality report for CPI\") for this statistical bulletin is available. The report assesses consumer price inflation statistics against standard dimensions of quality such as relevance, accuracy and accessibility. The report was last updated in October 2013.\n\t\n\tThe [mini Triennial Review (1.75 Mb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/triennial-reviews/triennial-review-of-the-consumer-prices-index-and-retail-prices-index-central-collection-of-prices-2012.pdf \"Report on the Triennial Review of the Consumer Prices Index and Retail Prices Index Central Collection of Prices\") of the CPI and RPI Central Collection of Prices is available.\n\n\tThe most efficient way to access the latest consumer price inflation data and briefing on our website is via the CPI key figure on the [homepage](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html \"Office for National Statistics\").\n\n\tIn response to user feedback, all consumer price inflation data are available in 1 location. The [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm:77-323657 \"Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables\") are provided via an Excel file.\n\n\tTo help users further, very detailed CPI data are now available including the [individual price quotes and item indices](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi-item-indices-and-price-quotes/index.html \"Consumer Price Indices (CPI) and Retail Prices Index (RPI) item indices and price quotes\") that underpin the CPI. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. The data published covers January 1996 to June 2015. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the November CPI is published on 15 December 2015, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to September 2015.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each member state of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of September 2015 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 16 September 2015. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&language=en&pcode=teicp000&tableSelection=1&plugin=1 \"HICP - all items\"). Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU member states is available from Eurostat's HICP web page.\n\n3. **Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation** \n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services (139.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi-basket-of-goods-and-services/cpi-2015-basket-of-goods.pdf \"CPI 2015 Basket of Goods\"). The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights (431.9 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi--updating-weights/2015.pdf \"Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights\").\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from Tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm:77-323657 \"Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables\"). By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/consumer-price-indices-technical-manual--2014.pdf \"Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual, 2014\").

The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n5. **Publication policy** \n\n\tThis bulletin includes the September 2015 data, collected on and around 8 September 2015.

Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. An [infographic](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/infographics/how-cpi-is-calculated/index.html \"How CPI is calculated\") explains how consumer price inflation is calculated. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to September 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between September 2014 and September 2015.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/users-and-uses-of-the-consumer-price-inflation-statistics.pdf \"Users and uses of Consumer Price Inflation statistics\").\n\n### Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between September 2014 and September 2015 stood at a negative 0.1%. This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in September 2014 would have cost £99.90 in September 2015. This continues the trend of most of 2015 when inflation had been at or around 0.0%.\n\nIn the year to September 2015, food prices fell by 2.5% and prices of motor fuels fell by 14.9%. These 2 groups have provided some of the largest downward contributions to the 12-month rate during 2015. In September 2015, the food and motor fuels groups in total reduced the CPI 12-month rate by approximately 0.8 percentage points. Historically, price movements for these products have been among the main causes of inflation. An article was published in November 2014 which outlined some [possible factors that may be affecting prices (477.2 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/what-is-affecting-prices-in-the-uk-in-2014-.pdf \"What is affecting prices in the UK in 2014?\").\n\nThe CPI can be divided into goods and services components. The 12-month rate for the former stood at a negative 2.4%, while the latter stood at a positive 2.5%. Over the last 25 years, goods inflation has generally been lower than services inflation. The gap between the two has widened noticeably over the last year, from 2.2 percentage points in the year to September 2014 to 4.9 percentage points in the year to September 2015 – the largest gap since April 2003. The impact of factory gate and raw material prices will likely have a larger impact on the price of goods, whereas wages and property costs could be larger factors for services.\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in September 2015 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.

An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. [Explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (37.1 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/explaining-the-contributions-to-change-in-12-month-rate.pdf \"Explaining the contributions to change in 12-month rate\") is a diagram explaining the calculation.\n\nThe CPI fell by 0.1% between August and September 2015 compared with a negligible change between the same 2 months a year earlier. This is the first time that the CPI has fallen between August and September.\n\nThe largest downward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between August and September 2015 came from:\n\n- **clothing and footwear**: prices, overall, rose by 2.8% between August and September this year compared with a larger rise of 4.0% between the same 2 months a year ago. As prices rose by less than a year ago, this resulted in a downward contribution to the CPI 12-month rate. Clothing prices, overall, always rise between August and September. However, this was the weakest growth since 2008, with a higher proportion of clothing items on sale in September 2015 when compared with September last year. Taking the summer (May to September) as a whole, clothing and footwear prices increased by 0.4% compared with larger increases of 0.9% and 1.2% over the same period in 2013 and 2014 respectively\n\n- **fuels and lubricants (part of the \"transport\" category)**: prices, overall, fell by 2.9% between August and September this year compared with a smaller fall of 0.6% between the same 2 months a year ago. The largest downward contribution came from petrol, with prices falling by 3.7 pence per litre between August and September this year compared with a fall of 0.8 pence per litre between the same 2 months a year ago. Diesel prices are now at their lowest level since December 2009, standing at 110.2 pence per litre\n\n- **gas (part of the \"housing and household services\" category)**: prices, overall, fell by 2.1% between August and September this year, compared with no change between the same 2 months a year ago, with price reductions from a major supplier\n\nThere were no notable upward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between August and September 2015.\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.

These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn September 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between September 2014 and September 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.2%, down from 0.3% in August 2015. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in September 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in August. Owner occupiers’ housing costs increased by 0.1% between August and September 2015, the same as between these months a year earlier. This meant it had a negligible impact on the change in the CPIH 12-month rate between the 2 months.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the official CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn September 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.1%, down from 0.5% in the year to August 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for September 2015 stood at 0.8%, meaning that it was 0.7 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 34.4% over the 10-year period, compared with 27.4% as measured by RPIJ. The use of the Carli formula has therefore added 7.0 percentage points to the change in prices over the last 10 years.

The announcement followed a review, led by Professor Sir Adrian Smith, which considered matters relating to the governance arrangements and structures underpinning the production of consumer price statistics.\n\n\tOn 27 November, the 2 panels met for the first time in a joint session. [Minutes and papers][1] were published on 14 December on our website. The panels will meet again on 22 January 2016.\n\n\t**Re-referencing of CPI and CPIH indices**\n\n\tFrom the release of January consumer price inflation data in February 2016, CPI and CPIH indices will be re-referenced and published with 2015=100. Regular re-referencing of indices is methodological good practice as it avoids rounding issues that can arise from small index values. Published CPI and CPIH inflation rates are calculated from unrounded indices, meaning that re-referencing will not impact on published inflation rates. Re-referencing will result in revisions to the CPI and CPIH indices. Full back series for each of the revised indices will be published shortly before publication of the January data. Re-referencing does not impact on RPI and RPIJ. Further details will be included in future CPI statistical bulletins. For more information please contact <cpi@ons.gsi.gov.uk>.\n\n\t**Correspondence with the Bank of England**\n\n\tSection 21 of the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 requires that, prior to making any change to the coverage or the basic calculation of the RPI, the UK Statistics Authority must consult the Bank of England as to whether any proposed change constitutes a fundamental change in the index which would be materially detrimental to the interests of the holders of relevant index-linked gilt edged securities. On 17 November 2015, ONS informed the Bank of England of the annual update to the basket of RPI items, and a review of the location boundaries wherein prices are collected. On 17 December 2015, the Bank concluded that these changes neither constituted a fundamental change in the index and nor was it likely to be materially detrimental to the holders of index-linked gilts.\n\n2. ###Understanding and accessing the data\n\n\tA full description of how consumer price indices are compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][2] (674.4 Kb Pdf). This is supplemented by infographics and textual information available from the [guidance and methodology][3] section of our website.\n\n\tA more detailed [quality report][4] (141.9 Kb Pdf) for this statistical bulletin is available. The report assesses consumer price inflation statistics against standard dimensions of quality such as relevance, accuracy and accessibility. The report was last updated in October 2013.\n\n\tThe mini [Triennial Review][5] (1.75 Mb Pdf) of the CPI and RPI Central Collection of Prices is available.\n\n\tThe most efficient way to access the latest consumer price inflation data and briefing on our website is via the CPI key figure on the homepage.\n\n\tIn response to user feedback, all consumer price inflation data are available in 1 location. The [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][6] are provided via an Excel file.\n\n\tTo help users further, very detailed CPI data are now available including the [individual price quotes and item indices][7] that underpin the CPI. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. The data published covers January 1996 to September 2015. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the February CPI is published on 22 March 2016, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to December 2015.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each member state of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of December 2015 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 19 January 2016. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables][8]. Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][9].\n\n3. ###Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation\n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services][10] (139.4 Kb Pdf). The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights][11] (431.9 Kb Pdf).\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][12]. By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][13] (674.4 Kb Pdf). [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics][14] (100.5 Kb Pdf) provides further details of how consumer price statistics are used more generally.\n\n4. ###Revisions policy\n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, a [revisions policy][15] (49.6 Kb Pdf) was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n5. ###Publication policy\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the December 2015 data, collected on and around 15 December 2015. Future [publication dates][16] for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2018 (the publication of the December 2017 inflation figures). Publication dates from February 2017 onwards are provisional.\n\n\tDetails of the policy governing the release of new data are available from our Media Relations Office. Also available is a list of the names of those given [pre-release access][17] to the contents of this release.\n\n\tIn line with the Consumer Price Inflation Pre-Release arrangements, an advanced estimate of the CPI was provided to the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer 4 working days ahead of publication. The Governor shared this information with the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and officials present at the MPC meeting, on Wednesday 13 January 2016.\n\n\tConsumer price inflation for January 2015 to January 2016 will be published on 16 February 2016.\n\n\tFollow us on [Twitter][18] or join us at [Facebook][19].\n\n\t**Media contact:**\n\n\tTel: Luke Croydon + 44 (0) 845 6041858</br>\n\tOut of hours media line + 44 (0) 7867 906553</br>\n\tEmail: <media.relations@ons.gsi.gov.uk>\n\n\t**Statistical contact:**\n\n\tTel: James Tucker +44 (0) 1633 456589</br>\n\tEmail: <cpi@ons.gsi.gov.uk>\n\n\tConsumer Price Inflation recorded message (available after 9.45am on release day):</br>\n\tTel: + 44 (0) 800 0113703 \n\n\tConsumer Price Inflation Enquiries:</br>\n\tTel: + 44 (0) 1633 456900\n\n6.

Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. An [infographic explains how consumer price inflation is calculated][1]. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to December 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between December 2014 and December 2015.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

              "markdown": "### What is the CPI?\n\nThe CPI is a measure of consumer price inflation produced to international standards and in line with European regulations. First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][1].\n\n### Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between December 2014 and December 2015 stood at 0.2%, a small increase compared with November 2015, when the rate was 0.1%. Although this is the first month since January 2015 for which the rate has exceeded 0.1%, this continues the trend since early 2015 of the rate being very close to zero. A rate of 0.2% means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in December 2014 would have cost £100.20 in December 2015.\n\nAs the rate has been very close to zero since early 2015, taken as a whole, households have experienced very little change in prices compared with the same months in 2014. Looking across the year overall, prices for transport costs, food and non-alcoholic beverages and (to a lesser extent) recreational and cultural goods and services have had a downward pull on the rate of inflation. These have been counterbalanced by an upward pull from price movements for other goods and services, most notably restaurant and hotel bills, and education costs such as university tuition fees.\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in December 2015 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.

An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. [Explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (37.1 Kb Pdf)][2] is a diagram explaining the calculation.\n\nThe CPI increased by 0.1% between November and December 2015, having been unchanged between the same 2 months a year earlier. The 1-month movement was therefore 0.1 percentage points higher this year compared with a year ago, leading to a rise in the CPI 12-month rate.\n\nBetween November and December 2015, the only substantial upward contribution to the change in the CPI 12-month rate came from:\n\n- transport: prices, overall, increased by 1.8% between November and December this year, compared with a fall of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward effect on the change in the 12-month rate came principally from air fares and to a lesser extent motor fuels. Air fares increased by 46% between November and December 2015 compared with 19% between the same 2 months a year earlier. This is the largest November to December price increase since 2002, although it is important to note that air fare prices are highly variable. November to December rises in excess of 40% were also seen in 2009 to 2011. Motor fuel prices fell by less than they did a year ago, meaning that they had an upward contribution to the change in the 12-month rate. Petrol prices fell by 3.4 pence per litre this year compared with a larger fall of 6.1 pence a year ago, while diesel fell by 2.3 pence this year compared with 4.8 pence a year ago\n\nThe largest downward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between November and December 2015 came from:\n\n- food and non-alcoholic beverages: prices, overall, fell by 0.2% between November and December this year, compared with a rise of 0.3% between the same 2 months a year ago. Price changes for cauliflower and potato crisps had the largest downward contribution to the change in the 12-month rate\n\n- alcoholic beverages and tobacco: prices, overall, fell by 1.3%, compared with a smaller fall of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year earlier. Wine and spirits were the main contributors to the change in the 12-month rate, with both showing larger price drops than in the same period a year ago\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.

              "markdown": "CPIH is currently undergoing re-assessment to evaluate the extent to which it meets the professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics. CPIH was first assessed in 2013. In August 2014 its National Statistics status was removed pending work to improve the methods for measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs in the index. [Full details][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website and in an [explanatory note][2] (313.9 Kb Pdf) on our website. The improvements from the resulting development work were introduced as part of the February 2015 dataset with the historical series revised back to 2005. Further information on the changes is available in 2 articles: [Improvements to the measurement of Owner Occupiers’ Housing Cost and Private Housing Rental Prices][3] (2.48 Mb Pdf) and [Revising the weight of Owner Occupiers’ Housing in CPIH][4] (197.4 Kb Pdf) .\n\nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn December 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between December 2014 and December 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.5%, up from 0.4% in November 2015. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in December 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in November 2015.\n\nOwners occupiers' housing costs increased by 0.2% between November and December 2015, the same as between these months a year earlier. This means that it had a very small impact on the change on the CPIH 12 month rate between the two months.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the official CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"f2b53064\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"c6ceb1b6\" />\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/consumer-price-indices-including-housing-costs-cpih-indicator/ \"Consumer Price Indices including Housing Costs (CPIH) Indicator\"\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpih-announcement-august-2014.pdf \"CPIH announcement August 2014\"\n  [3]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/improvements-to-the-measurement-of-owner-occupiers--housing.pdf \"Improvements to the measurement of owner occupiers’ housing costs and private housing rental prices\"\n  [4]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/revising-the-weight-of-owner-occupiers--housing-in-cpih.pdf \"Revising the weight of Owner Occupiers' Housing in CPIH\"",

The [full assessment report][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.\n\nThe RPI is a long-standing measure of UK inflation that has historically been used for a wide range of purposes such as the indexation of pensions, rents and index-linked gilts. For further information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics][2] (100.5 Kb Pdf).\n\nRPIJ is an improved variant of the Retail Prices Index, which is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn December 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.5%, up from 0.3% in the year to November 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for December 2015 stood at 1.2%, meaning that it was 0.7 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 34.3% over the 10-year period, compared with 27.2% as measured by RPIJ. The use of the Carli formula has therefore added 7.1 percentage points to the change in prices over the last 10 years.\n\nTable C shows the RPI and RPIJ 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"be0b2fce\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"c19bcfee\" />\n\nFor users who want to understand the causes of the difference between the CPI and RPI, please see Table 5 in the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][3].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/the-retail-prices-index/ \"The Retail Price Index\"\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/users-and-uses-of-the-consumer-price-inflation-statistics.pdf \"Users and uses of the consumer price inflation statistics\"\n  [3]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-323669 \"Consumer Price Inflation, December 2015 Reference Tables\"",

This change is being introduced as a result of the implementation of the new [UK House Price Index (UK HPI)][2] on 14 June 2016. The former ONS/DCLG HPI is currently used in RPI in the calculation of some housing components, namely mortgage interest payments, estate agents fees, ground rent and house depreciation. From March this will be replaced by a variant of the new UK HPI (calculated using an arithmetic mean rather than a geometric mean). For more information please see the exchange of letters between [ourselves][3] and the [Bank of England][4]. \n\n2. ###Revisions policy\n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, a [revisions policy][5] was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n3. ###Publication policy\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the January 2017 data, collected on and around 10 January 2017. Future [publication dates][6] for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2019 (the publication of the December 2018 inflation figures). Publication dates from February 2018 onwards are provisional.\n\n\tConsumer price inflation for February 2016 to February 2017 will be published on 21 March 2017.\n\n4. ###Recorded message\n\n\tConsumer price inflation recorded message (available after 9.45am on release day): \n\n\tTelephone: + 44 (0) 800 0113703\n\n5. ###Code of Practice\n\n\t[National Statistics][7] are produced to high professional standards set out in the [Code of Practice for Official Statistics][8]. They undergo regular quality assurance reviews to ensure that they meet customer needs. They are produced free from any political interference and released according to the arrangements approved by the [UK Statistics Authority][9].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/qualityassuranceofadministrativedatausedincpih\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/housepriceindex/dec2016\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk//economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/notificationofproposedchangestorpiin2017\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/bankofenglandresponsetoproposedchangestorpiin2017\n  [5]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/releasecalendar?query=UK%20consumer%20price%20inflation&fromDateDay=&fromDateMonth=&fromDateYear=&toDateDay=31&toDateMonth=1&toDateYear=2019&view=upcoming&size=10\n  [7]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/national-statistician/types-of-official-statistics/\n  [8]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/monitoring-and-assessment/code-of-practice/\n  [9]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/",

A way to understand this is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. Movements in price indices represent the changing cost of this basket. An [infographic][1] explains how consumer price inflation is calculated, and [Consumer price indices – a brief guide][2] gives an overview of the indices and their uses. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to January 2017, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between January 2016 and January 2017.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

              "markdown": "###What is the CPI?\n\nThe CPI is a measure of consumer price inflation produced to international standards and in line with European regulations. First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics][1].\n\n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between January 2016 and January 2017 stood at 1.8%. This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in January 2016 would have cost £101.80 in January 2017.\n\nThe January 2017 rate of 1.8% is an increase on the December 2016 figure and is the highest since June 2014 when it was 1.9%. At that time, the rate began to fall, subsequently remaining at or around zero for much of 2015 before gradually picking up from the end of the year and throughout 2016.\n\nThe strong downward pull on inflation seen in recent years for prices for food has lessened considerably over the last 4 months. The 12-month inflation rate for food stood at negative 0.4% in January 2017, the highest since June 2014. Transport prices continue to provide the strongest upward pressure.\n\n[Prices economic commentary: Feb 2017][2], also published today, presents further analysis of the latest CPI, Producer Price Index (PPI), House Price Index (HPI), construction output price indices (OPIs) and Index of Private Housing Rental Prices (IPHRP) results and emerging trends.\n\nFigure 1 shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in January 2017 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"8c77daa1\" />\n\nFigure 2 shows the CPI 12-month rate for the last 10 years. Table 1 shows the CPI 1-month rate (the amount prices change between 2 consecutive months), 12-month rate and index values for the last year.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"821b3a21\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"073dfbeb\" />\n\n###Consumer Prices Index (CPI): What are the main movements?\n\nThis section explains which goods and services had the biggest impact on the change to the 12-month rate between December 2016 and January 2017 and, where relevant, considers the longer-term inflationary trends for these goods and services.\n\nThe change in the CPI 12-month rate can be calculated by comparing the 12-month rates for 2 consecutive months. An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. [Explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (2013)][3] is a diagram explaining the calculation.\n\nThe CPI fell by 0.5% between December 2016 and January 2017, compared with a larger fall of 0.8% between the same 2 months a year earlier. This led to a rise in the CPI 12-month rate.\n\nThe main upward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between December 2016 and January 2017 came from the following groups:\n\nTransport: prices, overall, fell by 0.6% between December 2016 and January 2017, compared with a larger fall of 2.5% a year ago. Within transport, the largest upward effect came from motor fuels, with prices rising by 3.4% between December 2016 and January 2017, having fallen by 2.6% a year earlier. This continues the trend of increasing fuel prices seen since early 2016, reflecting movements in oil prices. Transport services, notably transport by air, road and rail, also contributed to the increase in the rate, as collectively prices fell by less than they did a year ago.\n\nFood and non-alcoholic beverages: the upward effect came from a wide range of food products, with prices for food overall being unchanged between December 2016 and January 2017, having fallen by 0.6% a year ago. Following a sustained period of deflation of food prices since mid-2014, during which the 12-month rate was often lower than negative 3.0%, the rate has increased for 4 consecutive months, reaching negative 0.4% in January 2017. This is the highest it has been since June 2014. [Prices economic commentary: Feb 2017][2] presents further analysis.\n\nThe main downward contribution to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between December 2016 and January 2017 came from:\n\nClothing and footwear: the downward effect was due to prices for a wide range of items of clothing and footwear. Overall, prices fell by 4.2% between December 2016 and January 2017, compared with a smaller fall of 3.1% last year. Sales patterns may have contributed to this, as the proportion of items on sale increased by more between December 2016 and January 2017 than it did a year ago. \n\nFigure 3 shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"9f19e5c2\" />\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/usersandusesofconsumerpriceinflationstatistics\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/priceseconomiccommentary/feb2017\n  [3]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html",

              "markdown": "The [Consumer Price Inflation Quality and Methodology Information page][1] is a good starting point for understanding the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH) and how it relates to other measures of inflation.\n\nCPIH has been reassessed to evaluate the extent to which it meets the professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics and the [assessment report][2] published on 3 March 2016. The report includes a number of requirements that need to be implemented for CPIH to regain its status as a National Statistic. The actions taken to address these requirements were reported to the UK Statistics Authority at the end of September 2016.\n\nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index. The [CPIH compendium][3] provides further information, including the rationale for the choice of methodology for measuring OOH, which is still extensively debated. We also publish data for alternative measures of OOH on a quarterly basis alongside the article [Understanding the different approaches of measuring owner occupiers' housing costs][4].\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words, this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable as a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage, the basket of goods and services and the method of deriving the weights are the same as for the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. A full description of how CPIH is compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][5] and the [CPIH compendium][6].\n\nIn January 2017, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between January 2016 and January 2017) for CPIH stood at 2.0%, up from 1.7% in December 2016. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in January 2017 was 0.2 percentage points, up from 0.1 percentage points in December 2016. \n\nFigure 4 shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates for the last 10 years. The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table 2 shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year. More CPIH data are available in Tables 21 to 34 of the [Consumer Price Inflation dataset][7].\n\n<ons-chart path=\"2a1eea3c\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"67c75c01\" />\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/qmis/consumerpriceinflationqmi\n  [2]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/statistics-on-consumer-price-inflation-including-owner-occupiers-housing-costs/\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/cpihcompendium/2016-10-13\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcosts/quarter3julytosept2016\n  [5]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/index.html\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/cpihcompendium/2016-10-13\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceinflation",

For further information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics][2].\n\nRPIJ is a variant of the RPI and is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between these indices.

Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.6 percentage points lower than the RPI. \n\nTable 3 shows the RPI and RPIJ 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"14529fa2\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"54ade69a\" />\n\nIf you would like to understand the causes of the difference between the CPI and RPI, please see Table 5 in the [Consumer Price Inflation dataset][3].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/the-retail-prices-index/\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/usersandusesofconsumerpriceinflationstatistics\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceinflation",

It contains important information on:\n\n- the strengths and limitations of the data and how it compares with related data\n- uses and users of the data\n- how the output was created\n- the quality of the output including the accuracy of the data\n\nA full description of how consumer price indices are compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][2]. This is supplemented by further information available from the [prices guidance and methodology page][3].\n\nThe [mini Triennial Review][4] of the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and Retail Prices Index (RPI) Central Collection of Prices is available.\n\nAll consumer price inflation data (including Excel dataset, time series data and explorable datasets) can be found on the [dataset page][5].\n\nTo help you further, very detailed data are published monthly, including the [individual price quotes (for locally collected items only) and item indices][6] that underpin the consumer price inflation statistics. Please note the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. \n\nInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each member state of the European Union (EU) according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of January 2017 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 22 February 2017. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables][7]. Further information on HICP for the EU, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][8].\n\n###Methods – CPI and other measures of inflation\n\nThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\nThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2016 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation Basket of Goods and Services: 2016][9]. The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2016 are available in an article published on 22 March 2016 entitled [Consumer Prices Index and Retail Prices Index – updating weights][10].\n\nRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from Tables 63 and 64 of the [Consumer Price Inflation dataset][11]. By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\nFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index, can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][12].

              "markdown": "1. ###News\n\n\t####Household Inflation Index\n\n\tOn 9 March 2016, the UK Statistics Authority published a letter from the National Statistician to the Chair of the Authority about the future of consumer inflation statistics. In the letter, he acknowledged calls for a measure of inflation showing the effect of changes in payments for goods and services, a so-called “Household Inflation Index” (HII). This index would be fundamentally different in a number of important aspects from the traditional measurement of consumer inflation. These differences include the potential inclusion of asset prices and interest payments, as well as giving each household’s expenditure equal weight. The HII could also be a vehicle for measuring different households’ experience of changes in prices. In July/August, we will publish a discussion paper based on our early explorations into the concepts of the HII. We are keen to receive feedback from users on the paper.\n\n\t####Re-assessment of CPIH\n\n\tCPIH has been re-assessed to evaluate the extent to which it meets the professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics and the assessment report [Statistics on consumer Price Inflation including Owner Occupiers’ Housing Costs][1], published on 3 March 2016. The report includes a number of requirements that need to be implemented for CPIH to regain its status as a National Statistic. The actions taken to address these requirements will be reported to the UK Statistics Authority by September 2016.\n\n\t####Personal Inflation Calculator\n\n\tThe interactive Personal Inflation Calculator which could be used by people to calculate their personal inflation based on their spending patterns has currently been removed from the website. The facility was used by a very small number of people.\n\n2. ###Understanding and accessing the data\n\n\tA full description of how consumer price indices are compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][2]. This is supplemented by further information available from the [prices guidance and methodology webpage][3].\n\n\tA more detailed [Consumer Price Inflation Quality and Methodology report][4] for this statistical bulletin is available. The report assesses consumer price inflation statistics against standard dimensions of quality such as relevance, accuracy and accessibility. The report was last updated in October 2013.\n\n\tThe [mini Triennial Review][5] of the CPI and RPI Central Collection of Prices is available.\n\n\tAll consumer price inflation data (including Excel dataset, time series data and explorable datasets) can be found on the [Consumer Price Inflation: June 2016][6].\n\n\tTo help users further, very detailed data are available, including the [individual price quotes (for locally collected items only) and item indices][7] that underpin the consumer price inflation statistics. The item indices behind the measurement of owner occupiers’ housing costs are included for the first time in the first quarter 2016 data. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider can be identified. The data published cover January 1996 to March 2016. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the August CPI is published on 13 September 2016, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to June 2016.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each member state of the European Union (EU) according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat released figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of June 2016 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 15 July 2016. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables][8]. Further information on HICP for the EU, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][9].\n\n3. ###Methods ‒ CPI and other measures of inflation\n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2016 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation Basket of Goods and Services: 2016][10]. The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2016 are available in an article published on 22 March 2016 entitled [Consumer Price Index and Retail Prices Index – updating weights: 2016][11].\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices, which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from Tables 63 and 64 of the [Consumer Price Inflation dataset][12]. By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index, can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices technical manual][13]. [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (2013)][14] provides further details of how consumer price statistics are used more generally.\n\n4. ###Revisions policy\n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, the [Consumer price inflation revisions policy][15] was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory, though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n5. ###Publication policy\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the June 2016 data, collected on and around 14 June 2016. Future [publication dates][16] for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2018 (the publication of the December 2017 inflation figures). Publication dates from February 2017 onwards are provisional.\n\n\tConsumer price inflation for July 2015 to July 2016 will be published on 16 August 2016.\n\n6. ###Recorded message\n\n\tConsumer price inflation recorded message (available after 9.45am on release day): \n\n\tTel: + 44 (0) 800 0113703<br>\n\n7. ###Code of Practice\n\n\t[National Statistics][17] are produced to high professional standards set out in the [Code of Practice for Official Statistics][18]. They undergo regular quality assurance reviews to ensure that they meet customer needs. They are produced free from any political interference and released according to the arrangements approved by the [UK Statistics Authority][19].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/statistics-on-consumer-price-inflation-including-owner-occupiers-housing-costs/\n  [2]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/index.html\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/pricesuserguidancemethodologyanddevelopments\n  [4]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/qmis/consumerpriceinflationqmi\n  [5]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/triennial-reviews/index.html\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/june2016/relateddata\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceindicescpiandretailpricesindexrpiitemindicesandpricequotes\n  [8]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&language=en&pcode=teicp000&tableSelection=1&plugin=1\n  [9]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/hicp/overview\n  [10]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/consumerpriceinflationbasketofgoodsandservices/2016\n  [11]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/consumerpricesindexandretailpricesindexupdatingweights/2016\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceinflation\n  [13]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/index.html\n  [14]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html\n  [15]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html\n  [16]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/publication-dates/index.html\n  [17]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/national-statistician/types-of-official-statistics/\n  [18]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/monitoring-and-assessment/code-of-practice/\n  [19]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/",

A way to understand this is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. Movements in price indices represent the changing cost of this basket. The infographic [How is the Consumer Price Index calculated?][1] explains how consumer price inflation is calculated. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to June 2016, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between June 2015 and June 2016.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

              "markdown": "###What is the CPI?\n\nThe CPI is a measure of consumer price inflation produced to international standards and in line with European regulations. First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the UK government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (2013)][1].\n\n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between June 2015 and June 2016 stood at 0.5%. This means that a basket of goods and services that would have cost £100.00 in June 2015 cost £100.50 in June 2016.\n\nThe rate is the same as observed for March and slightly above the 0.3% recorded for all other months of 2016. The rates for 2016 to date are still relatively low but are above those generally experienced in 2015, which was a year of historically low inflation, with the rate being at or around zero for much of the year. The largest downward pull on inflation in June 2016 and for 2016 to date comes from prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages. There also continues to be a downward pressure from transport prices, but this has eased during 2016 from the 2015 position. Upward pressures come from a variety of categories, most notably restaurant and hotel bills.\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in June 2016 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"1ba7e121\" />\n\nFigure B shows the CPI 12-month rate for the last 10 years. Table A shows the CPI 1-month rate (the amount prices change between 2 consecutive months), 12-month rate and index values for the last year.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"92dca899\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"446f4669\" />\n\n###Consumer Prices Index (CPI): What are the main movements?\n\nThis section explains which goods and services had the biggest impact on the change to the 12-month rate between May and June 2016 and, where relevant, considers the longer-term inflationary trends for these goods and services.\n\nThe change in the CPI 12-month rate can be calculated by comparing the 12-month rates for 2 consecutive months. An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. The diagram [explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (2013)][2] explains the calculation.\n\nThe CPI rose by 0.2% between May and June 2016, compared with a negligible change between the same 2 months a year earlier. The 1-month movement was therefore 0.2 percentage points higher this year compared with a year ago, leading to a rise in the CPI 12-month rate.\n\nBetween May and June 2016, the main upward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate came from the following groups.\n\nTransport: prices, overall, rose by 1.1% between May and June this year compared with a rise of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. Within transport, the largest upward effect came from air fares, which rose by more than a year ago, with the main contribution coming from European routes. The 10.9% rise in fares this year was the largest May to June movement on record although it is important to note that air fares are highly variable. Motor fuel prices also rose by more than a year ago, with petrol and diesel prices rising by 2.3 and 2.6 pence per litre respectively between May and June 2016. A smaller upward effect came from changes in sea transport fares, though this was offset by a downward pull from rail transport.\n\nRecreation and culture: prices, overall, rose by 0.6% this year compared with a fall of 0.1% a year ago. The upward contribution came principally from games, toys and hobbies (particularly computer games) with prices rising between May and June 2016 compared with a fall last year. Other smaller upward effects came from cultural services and books.\n\nCommunication: the upward contribution came from telephone equipment and services with prices, overall, rising by 0.6% between May and June this year compared with a fall of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. The effect came principally from mobile phone charges which fell this year but by less than a year ago.\n\nThe main downward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between May and June 2016 came from the following groups.\n\nFurniture, household equipment and maintenance: prices, overall, fell by 0.3% between May and June this year but rose by 0.3% between the same 2 months a year ago. The downward contribution came almost entirely from furniture and furnishings, particularly kitchen units.\n\nRestaurants and hotels: prices, overall, rose by 0.1% this year compared with a larger rise of 0.4% a year ago. The downward effect came from accommodation services, where prices for overnight hotel accommodation fell this year but rose a year ago.\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to the change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"83b98228\" />\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html\n  [2]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html",

The report includes a number of requirements that need to be implemented for CPIH to regain its status as a National Statistic. The actions taken to address these requirements will be reported to the UK Statistics Authority by September 2016.\n\nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words, this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 16.5% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage, the basket of goods and services and the method of deriving the weights are the same as for the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. A full description of how CPIH is compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices technical manual][2] and in various papers published on the [prices guidance and methodology webpage][3].\n\nIn June 2016, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between June 2015 and June 2016) for CPIH stood at 0.8%, up from 0.7% in May 2016. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in June 2016 was 0.3 percentage points, down from 0.4 percentage points in May. This narrowing was principally due to rounding. Owner occupiers’ housing costs increased by 0.1% between May and June 2016, the same as the movement between these months a year earlier. This meant that they had a negligible impact on the change in the CPIH 12-month rate between the 2 months.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates for the last 10 years. The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The [full assessment report][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.\n\nThe RPI is a long-standing measure of UK inflation that has historically been used for a wide range of purposes such as the indexation of pensions, rents and index-linked gilts. For further information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (2013)][2].\n\nRPIJ is an improved variant of the RPI and is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, and so on as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series, in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn June 2016, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.9%, up from 0.7% in May.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for June 2016 stood at 1.6%, meaning that it was 0.7 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years.

The announcement followed a review, led by Professor Sir Adrian Smith, which considered matters relating to the governance arrangements and structures underpinning the production of consumer price statistics.\n\n\tOn 27 November, the 2 panels met for the first time in joint session. [Minutes and papers][1] were published on 14 December 2015 on the ONS website.\n\n\t**Measuring Consumer Prices: the options for change consultation**\n\n\tThe UK Statistics Authority [public consultation][2] on consumer price statistics closed on 15 September and a s[ummary of the responses][3] was published on 23 November on the UK Statistics Authority website. The Authority will consider these responses carefully, along with advice from its regulatory function and the newly established Advisory Panels for Consumer Price Statistics, before issuing its final response in the first half of 2016.\n\n\t**Re-referencing of CPI and CPIH indices**\n\n\tFrom the release of January consumer price inflation data in February 2016, CPI and CPIH indices will be re-referenced and published with 2015=100. Regular re-referencing of indices is methodological good practice as it avoids rounding issues that can arise from small index values. Published CPI and CPIH inflation rates are calculated from unrounded indices, meaning that re-referencing will not impact on published inflation rates. Re-referencing will result in revisions to the CPI and CPIH indices. Full back series for each of the revised indices will be published shortly before publication of the January data. Re-referencing does not impact on RPI and RPIJ. Further details will be included in future CPI statistical bulletins. For more information please contact <cpi@ons.gsi.gov.uk>.\n\n2. **Understanding and accessing the data**\n\n\tA full description of how consumer price indices are compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)][4]. This is supplemented by infographics and textual information available from the [guidance and methodology][5] section of our website.\n\n\tA [more detailed quality report (141.9 Kb Pdf)][6] for this statistical bulletin is available. The report assesses consumer price inflation statistics against standard dimensions of quality such as relevance, accuracy and accessibility. The report was last updated in October 2013.\n\n\tThe [mini Triennial Review (1.75 Mb Pdf)][7] of the CPI and RPI Central Collection of Prices is available.\n\n\tThe most efficient way to access the latest consumer price inflation data and briefing on our website is via the CPI key figure on the [homepage][8].\n\n\tIn response to user feedback, all consumer price inflation data are available in 1 location. The [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][9] are provided via an Excel file.\n\n\tTo help users further, very detailed CPI data are now available including the [individual price quotes and item indices][10] that underpin the CPI. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. Previously the data published covered January 1996 to June 2015. The data for July to September 2015 are also now available. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the February CPI is published on 22 March 2016, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to December 2015.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each member state of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of November 2015 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 16 December 2015. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables][11]. Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][12].\n\n3. **Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation**\n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services (139.4 Kb Pdf)][13]. The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights (431.9 Kb Pdf)][14].\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][15]. By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)][16]. [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][17] provides further details of how consumer price statistics are used more generally.\n\n4. **Revisions policy**\n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, a [revisions policy (49.6 Kb Pdf)][18] was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n5. **Publication policy**\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the November 2015 data, collected on and around 10 November 2015. Future [publication dates][19] for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2018 (the publication of the December 2017 inflation figures). Publication dates from February 2017 onwards are provisional.\n\n\tDetails of the policy governing the release of new data are available from our Media Relations Office. Also available is a list of the names of those given [pre-release access][20] to the contents of this release.\n\n\tIn line with the Consumer Price Inflation Pre-Release arrangements, an advanced estimate of the CPI was provided to the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer 4 working days ahead of publication. The Governor shared this information with the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and officials present at the MPC meeting, on Wednesday 9 December 2015. The pre-release access to the November CPI figures was extended to 4 working days from 3.5 working days due to the timing of the MPC meeting being moved forward half a day.\n\n\tConsumer price inflation for December 2014 to December 2015 will be published on 19 January 2016.\n\n\tFollow us on [Twitter][21] or join us at [Facebook][22].\n\n\t**Media contact**: <br>\n\tTel: Luke Croydon + 44 (0) 845 6041858 <br>\n\tOut of hours media line + 44 (0) 7867 906553 <br>\n\tEmail: <media.relations@ons.gsi.gov.uk>\n\n\t**Statistical contact**: <br>\n\tTel: Philip Gooding +44 (0) 1633 455896 <br>\n\tEmail: <cpi@ons.gsi.gov.uk> \n\n\tConsumer Price Inflation recorded message (available after 9.45am on release day): <br>\n\tTel: + 44 (0) 800 0113703 \n\n\tConsumer Price Inflation Enquiries: <br>\n\tTel: + 44 (0) 1633 456900\n\n6.

Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. An [infographic][1] explains how consumer price inflation is calculated. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to November 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between November 2014 and November 2015.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

              "markdown": "###What is the CPI?\n\nThe CPI is a measure of consumer price inflation produced to international standards and in line with European regulations. First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][1].\n\n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between November 2014 and November 2015 stood at 0.1%. This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in November 2014 would have cost £100.10 in November 2015.\n\nSince early 2015, the CPI 12-month rate has been very close to 0.0%. This means that, taken as a whole, households have experienced very little change in prices compared with the same months in 2014. However, the picture for individual households depends on the goods and services that they buy. Looking across the year as a whole, prices for transport costs, food and non-alcoholic beverages and (to a lesser extent) recreational and cultural goods and services have had a downward pull on the rate of inflation. These have been counterbalanced by an upward pull from price movements for other goods and services, most notably restaurant and hotel bills, and education costs such as university tuition fees.\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in November 2015 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.

An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. [Explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (37.1 Kb Pdf)][2] is a diagram explaining the calculation.\n\nThe CPI was little changed between October and November 2015 compared with a fall of 0.3% between the same 2 months a year earlier. The 1-month movement was therefore 0.3 percentage points higher this year compared with a year ago, leading to a rise in the CPI 12-month rate. The difference between the movements in the annual and monthly rates is due to rounding.\n\nThe largest upward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between October and November 2015 came from:\n\n- **transport: prices**, overall, fell by 0.7% between October and November this year compared with a larger fall of 1.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. As prices fell by less than last year, this resulted in an upward contribution to the CPI 12-month rate. Within transport, the upward effects came principally from motor fuels and second-hand cars. Petrol prices fell by 1.5 pence per litre this year compared with a fall of 3.0 pence per litre a year ago while diesel fell by 0.6 pence this year compared with 2.9 pence a year ago. Second-hand car prices rose by 1.6% this year compared with a fall of 1.0% a year ago.\n\n- **alcoholic beverages and tobacco**: prices, overall, fell by 0.1% between October and November this year compared with a fall of 1.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward contributions came from spirits and wine.\n\n- **miscellaneous goods and services**: prices, overall, rose by 0.3% between October and November this year compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. Some of the upward effect came from car insurance premiums which rose by more than a year ago, with Insurance Premium Tax rising from 6% to 9.5% at the start of November 2015 as announced in the Summer 2015 Budget. There was also an upward contribution from other personal effects, where prices of items such as luggage rose by more than a year ago.\n\nThe largest downward contribution to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between October and November 2015 came from:\n\n- **clothing and footwear**: prices, overall, fell by 0.1% between October and November this year compared with a rise of 0.7% between the same 2 months a year ago. This is the first fall in prices between October and November since official records began in 1996 and follows the largest September to October price increase on record. It continues the trend seen since the summer of atypical monthly price movements in the clothing and footwear sector. The contribution to change this month came primarily from price movements for a broad range of outerwear (particularly women’s trousers) with more products on sale this November than a year ago.\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.

CPIH was first assessed in 2013. In August 2014 its National Statistics status was removed pending work to improve the methods for measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs in the index. [Full details][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website and in an [explanatory note (313.9 Kb Pdf)][2] on our website. The improvements from the resulting development work were introduced as part of the February 2015 dataset with the historical series revised back to 2005. Further information on the changes is available in 2 articles: [Improvements to the measurement of Owner Occupiers’ Housing Cost and Private Housing Rental Prices (2.48 Mb Pdf)][3] and  [Revising the weight of Owner Occupiers’ Housing in CPIH (197.4 Kb Pdf)][4].\n\nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn November 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between November 2014 and November 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.4%, up from 0.2% in October 2015. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in November 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in October, despite a small upward contribution from owner occupiers’ housing costs.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the official CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The [full assessment report][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.\n\nThe RPI is a long-standing measure of UK inflation that has historically been used for a wide range of purposes such as the indexation of pensions, rents and index-linked gilts. For further information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][2].\n\nRPIJ is an improved variant of the Retail Prices Index, which is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn November 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.3%, up from 0.0% in the year to October 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for November 2015 stood at 1.1%, meaning that it was 0.8 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 34.2% over the 10-year period, compared with 27.1% as measured by RPIJ. The use of the Carli formula has therefore added 7.1 percentage points to the change in prices over the last 10 years.

              "markdown": "Figures in this bulletin are averaged across all UK households, unless stated otherwise.\n\nThis bulletin uses the mean when referring to averages. Therefore, total average weekly household expenditure is equal to the total weekly expenditure of households divided by the number of households. \n\nThis bulletin compares spending over time in 2 different ways, where figures are either adjusted for inflation or not adjusted for inflation. Where figures are not adjusted for inflation, differences in spending could be because of differences in price level between the years. When comparing spending that has been adjusted for inflation, differences in price between years are not a legitimate reason for differences in spending, as this has already been taken into account. Where possible, we adjust for inflation when comparing levels of spending over time. However, for more detailed expenditure items this is not possible and we therefore compare unadjusted figures. Please see the Quality and methodology section for more information on comparisons over time.\n\nChanges and differences said to be statistically significant are significant at the 95% confidence level, unless stated otherwise.\n\nThis bulletin considers expenditure by UK constituent country and English region. We combine 3 years of data when presenting spending broken down by country and region in order to improve the robustness of results.\n\nSpending is presented using classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP) categories, unless otherwise stated. COICOP is an internationally recognised classification system consistent with that used by UK National Accounts. It does not include all types of payments; for example, capital mortgage repayments are excluded. Due to high interest in this topic, this bulletin also considers housing costs outside the COICOP classification system. Further information on COICOP can be found on the [United Nations Statistics Division website][1].\n\nWe use equivalised disposable income decile groups when looking at expenditure and income together. Disposable income is defined as gross weekly cash income less the statutory deductions and payments of Income Tax and National Insurance contributions. It is used alongside expenditure as it is the amount households have available to spend or save. Equivalisation takes into account that households with many members are likely to need a higher income to achieve the same standard of living as households with fewer members. Please see the Quality and methodology section for more information on equivalisation. For ownership of durable goods, gross income decile groups are used. The standard concept of gross income is gross weekly cash income current at the time of interview; that is, before the deduction of Income Tax actually paid, National Insurance contributions and other deductions at source.\n\nResults presented in this bulletin cover the financial year ending 2016 (2015/16); that is, April 2015 to March 2016. The move to financial year comes following user demand. [Financial year ending 2015 (2014/15) tables][2] are also available to provide comparability.\n\nIn [response][3] to a recent Office for National Statistics [consultation][4], this edition of Family Spending is published as a statistical bulletin for the first time. Our users are central to the way we develop this bulletin in the future. Please [let us know][5] what you think of this new format.\n\nFamily Spending has been designated by the [UK Statistics Authority][6] as National Statistics, in accordance with the [Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007][7] and signifying compliance with the [Code of Practice for Official Statistics][8].\n\n\n  [1]: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regct.asp?Lg=1\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/bulletins/familyspendingintheuk/financialyearendingmarch2016/relateddata\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/aboutus/whatwedo/statistics/consultationsandsurveys/allconsultationsandsurveys/consultationonchangestoonsproducts2015/responsetoconsultationfinal.pdf\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/aboutus/whatwedo/statistics/consultationsandsurveys/allconsultationsandsurveys/consultationonchangestoonsproducts2015/consultationonchangestoonsproducts2015v2_tcm77-427693.doc\n  [5]: https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/ZWGLB5B\n  [6]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/national-statistician/types-of-official-statistics/\n  [7]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/uk-statistical-system/legislation/key-legislative-documents/\n  [8]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/monitoring-and-assessment/code-of-practice/\n",

              "markdown": "Total average weekly household expenditure remained level at £528.90 in the financial year ending 2016 (2015/16) when compared with the same period a year ago, where figures are adjusted for inflation.\n\nFigure 1 shows average weekly household spending, over a longer time period. \n\n####Figure 1: Total household expenditure, UK, financial year ending 2002 to financial year ending 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc389/bar_line/index.html\" />\n\nWhen considering spending that has been adjusted for inflation, Figure 1 shows that in recent years spending has increased from its lowest level of £507.20 seen in 2012. However, average spending has not returned to the pre-economic downturn levels of spending seen before 2007. It is useful to consider average expenditure alongside other economic indicators in order to understand the wider picture of the UK economy in 2015/16.\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) showed [output grew steadily in 2015/16][1] and the [employment rate][2] increased to 74.2% in Quarter 1 (January to March) of 2016, up from 73.4% in Quarter 2 (April to June) of 2015. Alongside this, [average earnings][3] and median household [disposable income][4] also grew when adjusted for inflation. However, despite an increase in median disposable income overall, disposable income grew at a slower rate for the richest fifth of households between 2014/15 and 2015/16. The median income for the richest fifth of households has actually fallen by 3.4% in real terms since the economic downturn of 2007/08.\n\nInflation shows the rate prices of goods and services bought by households rise or fall. Prices, and therefore inflation, directly influences the amount households spend. During 2015/16, inflation measured by the Consumer Prices Index [was very low][5] and even entered a period of deflation. This means that overall, goods and services were the same price or even cheaper than they were in the previous year. \n\nWe can also look at consumer confidence. Since the economic downturn, [consumer confidence][6] has been on an upward trend and began to accelerate at a quicker rate in 2013 and 2014. However, during the 2015/16 period, growth in consumer confidence began to level off. [Further breakdown][7] of consumer confidence figures suggests that this could have been driven by falling expectations of the country’s general economic situation. \n\nThese indicators suggest that despite economic growth and higher real disposable income, the average household was not influenced to spend either more or less on goods and services in 2015/16 after adjusting for inflation. This may reflect a relative weakness in consumer confidence, which may have held back spending. It may also reflect the different growth rate of real disposable household income across the income distribution. \n\n###Household expenditure by category\n\nTransport and housing (net), fuel and power were the highest expenditure classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP) categories. The average weekly amount spent on transport in the financial year ending 2016 (2015/16) was £72.70. The largest contributing factor to this was motor fuels such as petrol and diesel. Although overall spending on transport remained unchanged compared with a year ago, there were changes in lower level categories. \n\nCompared with previous years, expenditure on motor fuels decreased in 2015/16, where figures are not adjusted for inflation. [Fuel prices fell][8] in this time period following a global fall in the price of crude oil. In 2015/16, there was an increase in spending on second-hand cars or vans following an increase in [sales][9]. There was also an increase in spending on new cars or vans bought using a loan or hire purchase scheme. The increase in loans was noted by the Bank of England in the last quarter of 2015 as they [observed a rise][10] in the number of people buying goods and services on credit. The increase in the amount spent on cars is supported by what we see in [Table A45][11]. This shows that 78% of UK households owned a car or van in 2015/16, compared with 76% in the previous year. \n\nThe average weekly amount spent on housing, fuel and power was £72.50. We consider housing in more detail in [Section 5][12] of this bulletin.\n\n<ons-table path=\"8901f65a\" />\n\nFigure 2 shows the detailed level of spending within each COICOP category.\n\n####Figure 2: Household expenditure in the UK, financial year ending 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc389/treemap/index.html\" />\n\n###Household expenditure by region\n\nAs well as looking at average spending by category, we can look at regional average spending as shown by Figure 3. We combine 3 years of data when presenting spending broken down by country and region. On this basis, the average weekly household expenditure in the UK combined over financial years ending 2014, 2015 and 2016 was £527.20.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"3a7e8ddd\" />\n\nFigure 3 shows that average spending varied throughout the different regions of the UK. London had the highest average weekly household expenditure of £652.40, whilst the North East’s average weekly spending was more than £200 lower at £423.50. This is driven by housing costs, which are discussed in [Section 5][13]. For the majority of regions, transport, or housing (net), fuel and power was the highest expenditure category. However, there were some exceptions. For the North East, the North West, and Yorkshire and The Humber, households spent the most amount of money on recreation and culture. Spending on recreation and culture is explored in more depth in [Section 6][14].  \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/grossdomesticproductpreliminaryestimate/octtodec2016\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/timeseries/lf24/lms\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2016provisionalresults\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2016\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/dec2016\n  [6]: https://data.oecd.org/leadind/consumer-confidence-index-cci.htm\n  [7]: http://www.gfk.com/fileadmin/user_upload/dyna_content/GB/documents/Press_Releases/2016/GfK_Consumer_Confidence__-_December_2016.pdf\n  [8]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/oil-and-petroleum-products-monthly-statistics\n  [9]: http://www.am-online.com/news/used-cars/2015/10/21/uk-records-rapid-increase-in-used-car-sales-in-q2\n  [10]: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/other/monetary/ccs/2016/q4.aspx\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/percentageofhouseholdswithdurablegoodsuktablea45\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/bulletins/familyspendingintheuk/financialyearendingmarch2016#what-factors-influence-your-expenditure-on-housing-and-household-goods-and-services\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/bulletins/familyspendingintheuk/financialyearendingmarch2016#what-factors-influence-your-expenditure-on-housing-and-household-goods-and-services\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/bulletins/familyspendingintheuk/financialyearendingmarch2016#uk-households-spent-more-than-4500-a-week-on-restaurants-and-hotels-for-the-first-time-in-5-years",

              "markdown": "The UK average weekly spending on food and non-alcoholic drinks consumed at home was £56.80. [Table 4.1][1] shows that after adjusting for inflation, spending on food and non-alcoholic drinks has remained the same since 2011. Furthermore, spending on food and non-alcoholic drinks has made up 11% of total expenditure since 2008. Whilst all households have to spend a certain amount on food and drink, there is a limit to how much food households consume and the amount they are willing to spend overall.\n\nWe can also look at spending on food and non-alcoholic drink where figures have not been adjusted for inflation. This shows that spending on this category has decreased in the financial year ending 2016 (2015/16) because [food prices][2] fell. One of the causes of lower food prices is the emergence of discount supermarkets in the UK, which has led to [greater competition][3].\n\nIt is interesting to compare expenditure on food and non-alcoholic drinks over different income groups. Figure 4 shows that lower income households spent a higher proportion of their total expenditure on food and non-alcoholic drinks; this is similar to patterns seen in previous years. In 2015/16, households with the lowest income spent 17% of total expenditure on food and non-alcoholic drinks. In comparison, households with the highest income spent 8% of total expenditure on this category, leaving these households more money to spend elsewhere, such as on eating out.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"1c51a481\" />\n\nWe are also able to look at the proportion of total food expenditure that was spent on different types of food over the income groups. Households in the lowest income group spent 5% of their total food budget on milk while households in the highest income group spent 3%. There is a similar pattern for bread, suggesting lower income households assigned more of their food budget to basic groceries. In contrast, higher income households spent a higher proportion of their food budget on vegetables.\n\nHousing fuel, like food and drink, is essential for all UK households. In 2015/16, the [price of electricity and gas][4] fell following the fall in global oil prices. In addition to this, the UK government ran a [campaign][5] encouraging users to switch energy providers in order to get the best deal. Both of these factors would influence spending on electricity, gas and other fuels.\n\nThe 2015/16 average weekly expenditure on electricity and gas was £11.50 and £10.70 respectively. This is a reduction when comparing with the previous year, where figures are not adjusted for inflation. However, similar to food and non-alcoholic drinks, those in the lowest income groups spend a greater part of their total expenditure on electricity, gas and other fuel. Figure 5 shows that those in the lowest income group spent 9% of their total expenditure on electricity, gas and other fuels. In comparison, expenditure on housing fuel made up 3% of total expenditure for those with the highest income. This is similar to patterns seen in previous years.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"b5e929f4\" />\n\nAlthough [median household disposable income][6] rose in 2015/16, lower income households continued to spend a higher proportion of their total expenditure on food and fuel when compared with higher income households. This suggests that households with a lower income had less money to spend on non-essential items. This can be seen in [Table 3.2E][7], which shows that lower income households spent 9% of total expenditure on recreation and culture, compared with higher income households who spent 14% of expenditure on this category.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/householdexpenditureat201516pricesuktable41\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/dec2016\n  [3]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/effects-on-prices-in-the-uk/2014/sty-what-is-affecting-prices-in-the-uk-in-2014.html\n  [4]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/annual-domestic-energy-price-statistics\n  [5]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/bill-payers-missing-out-on-22bn\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2016\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/detailedhouseholdexpenditureasapercentageoftotalexpenditurebyequivaliseddisposableincomedecilegroupoecdmodifiedscaleuk32e",

              "markdown": "In this section we will look at the average weekly amount spent on housing and household goods and services. In order to provide a more complete view of housing costs, we do not use the classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP) definition of housing as some expenditure is excluded. The housing costs discussed in this section include:\n\n- net rent (that is, the amount payable by a household after housing benefits have been deducted)\n\n- mortgage payments\n\n- repairs and maintenance\n\n- home improvements\n\nExpenditure on housing fuel is considered in [Section 4][1].\n \nIn the financial year ending 2016 (2015/16), the average weekly amount spent on housing costs for UK households was £164.70. As shown in [Table 2.2][2], this is an increase on the previous year, where figures are not adjusted for inflation. \n\nSimilar to previous years, mortgages (27%), net rent (20%) and charges (18%), such as Council Tax and water charges, were the top 3 housing costs. \n\nHousing costs can differ depending on tenure. In 2015/16, the breakdown of different types of households was:\n\n- rented households (both private and social): 36%\n\n- mortgage held: 30%\n\n- owned the property outright: 34%\n\nSince 2006, there has been an increase in the number of rented households in the UK and a decrease in the number of houses being bought with a mortgage. This trend was also observed by the [English Housing Survey][3]. Despite various [government schemes][4] to help people onto the property ladder, this trend continued in 2015/16. In 2015/16, there were 6 rented households for every 5 households being bought by a mortgage holder. \n\n###Housing costs for renters and mortgage holders\n\nAs shown in [Table 2.8][5], the 2015/16 average weekly net expenditure for rent was £92.00. This averages out rent across all renting households, not all UK households. This means that 19% of a renting household’s total expenditure was spent on net rent, where net rent is the rent payment that the households have to meet themselves – benefits and rebates received by the households to help pay for rent have been subtracted. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"5406a5ae\" />\n\nFigure 6 shows that average net rent varies widely throughout the UK. The average weekly amount spent on rent in London was £167.10; this is more than double the average in the majority of other regions, excepting the East of England, South East and South West. London has the highest proportion of renters in the UK, where [nearly half of all households rent][6]. Regional rent appears correlated with [regional house prices][7], where London, East of England, South East and South West have the highest house prices. \n\nThe 2015/16 average weekly mortgage payment was higher than the average rent, at £147.60. Again, this averages out mortgage payments across all households paying a mortgage, not all UK households. Although this is higher than the average net rent, it makes up 13% of total expenditure for mortgage holders. This is 6 percentage points less than the proportion of total expenditure spent on rent by rented households. This means that although average expenditure on net rent is less than the average expenditure on mortgage payments, rented households have less money to spend on other goods and services. \n\n###Expenditure on household goods and services\n\nAs well as housing costs, we can look at the amount spent on household goods and services. This category looks at spending on items such as furniture, household appliances, cleaning materials and tools. In 2015/16, the average weekly amount spent on household goods and services was £35.50, level to the amount seen in the previous year after figures have been adjusted for inflation. Spending on furniture contributed the most to this cost, where on average a UK household spent £15.80 a week.\n\nHouseholds spent an average of £2.40 a week on household appliances. [Table A45][8] shows the percentage of households that own certain durable goods, including household appliances. In 2015/16, of all households 97% owned a washing machine and 93% owned a microwave. On the other hand, only 56% of households owned a tumble dryer and less than half of households owned a dishwasher (45%).\n\nIt is interesting to look at the ownership of these goods across income groups, as shown in [Table A46][9]. There is little difference across income groups when looking at the ownership of washing machines and microwaves. There are much bigger differences across income groups when we consider ownership of tumble dryers and dishwashers. Unlike washing machines, which can be considered a [necessity][10], tumble dryers and dishwashers can be considered to be more luxury goods. Only 14% of households in the lowest income group owned a dishwasher, compared with 84% of households in the highest income group. \n\nThis section shows that where you live, whether you rent or are buying your house with the help of a mortgage and your income influence spending on housing and household goods and services.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/bulletins/familyspendingintheuk/financialyearendingmarch2016#lower-income-households-continued-to-have-less-money-to-spend-on-non-essential-items\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/housingexpenditureuktable22\n  [3]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/501065/EHS_Headline_report_2014-15.pdf\n  [4]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/brandon-lewis-welcomes-housebuilding-surge\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/expenditureonrentbyrentersuktable28\n  [6]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/a-century-of-home-ownership-and-renting-in-england-and-wales/short-story-on-housing.html\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/housepriceindex/nov2016\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/percentageofhouseholdswithdurablegoodsuktablea45\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/percentageofhouseholdswithdurablegoodsbyincomegroupandhouseholdcompositionuktablea46\n  [10]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Material_deprivation",

              "markdown": "In addition to spending on food, fuel and housing, we can look at how UK households spent their money after they had paid for essential items. This is sometimes known as [discretionary spending][1]. \n\nIn the financial year ending 2016 (2015/16), UK households spent an average of £45.10 on restaurants and hotels. This is an increase of £1.80 when compared with the previous year, where figures have been adjusted for inflation, and is significant at the 10% level. High levels of [employment][2] and rising [disposable income][3] might be factors influencing this increase. \n\nThis category includes spending on goods and services such as:\n\n- restaurant and café meals (£17.30)\n\n- alcoholic drinks consumed away from home (£7.50)\n\n- takeaway meals (£4.70)\n\n- accommodation services (£8.90)\n\nMost sub-categories saw an increase in spending between the financial year ending 2015 (2014/15) and 2015/16, figures not adjusted for inflation, where spending on restaurant and café meals had the biggest contribution. However, the average weekly amount spent on restaurant and café meals varies throughout the UK when we look at 3 years of combined data. For London, the average weekly amount was £21.50, whilst households in Wales had a weekly average amount more than £7.00 lower at £14.20. This may reflect regional price differences, in addition to varying lifestyles. \n\n###Expenditure on recreation and culture\n\nRecreation and culture is another discretionary spending category. The UK average weekly spending on recreation and culture in 2015/16 was £68.00, similar to the spending seen in 2014/15 (£68.90) where figures are adjusted for inflation. This category covers a wide variety of goods and services such as:\n\n- cinema, theatre and museums and so on (£2.60)\n\n- TV subscription and licences (£6.80)\n\n- newspapers, books and stationery (£5.30)\n\n####Figure 7: Expenditure on recreation and culture in the UK, financial year ending 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc389/treemap/index.html#c9\" />\n\nAlthough spending on recreation and culture can be seen as discretionary, it was the category with the third highest expenditure in the UK. In fact, recreation and culture was the category with the highest spending for the North East, the North West, and Yorkshire and The Humber. These 3 regions spent 14% of their total expenditure on recreation and culture, compared with 11% in London. This difference was driven by the North East, North West, and Yorkshire and The Humber spending a higher proportion of expenditure on package holidays abroad.\n\nWe can look at spending on recreation and culture by age, as shown in [Table A10][4]. When we consider household spending by age, we look at the age of the person legally responsible for the household accommodation. We call this person the household reference person (HRP). \n\nTable A10 shows that households where the HRP was aged 65 to 74 spent the greatest proportion of their budgets on recreation and culture when compared with the other age categories. This age group spent 18% of their total expenditure on recreation and culture, whilst the under-30s spent 9%. Households with a HRP aged 65 to 74 spent a higher proportion of expenditure on the majority of recreation and culture sub-categories when compared with other age groups. This includes major durables, leisure classes and package holidays. This may be down to this age group having more time to spend on recreation and culture after they have retired. Interestingly, this pattern is not seen in restaurants and hotels, where spending is more equal between the age categories. \n\n###Expenditure on alcohol and tobacco \n\nThere was a significant decrease in the average weekly amount spent on alcoholic drinks and tobacco between 2014/15 and 2015/16 when we consider figures that have been adjusted for inflation. Households spent an average of £11.40 a week on this category in 2015/16; this is a decrease of a third across the decade.\n\nAlcohol and tobacco are considered to be demerit goods. These are goods that:\n\n- are [harmful][5] [to the consumer][6]\n\n- impose [costs on third parties][7]\n\nHowever, the consumer may be unaware or choose to ignore the damaging effects. In order to discourage consumption of these goods, the government can introduce a variety of measures designed to discourage consumption. This can include health awareness campaigns, legislation, taxation and minimum pricing. For example, during 2015/16, smoking in cars that contain children [was banned][8] in England and Wales. \n\nFigure 8 shows that expenditure on alcohol and tobacco has been steadily decreasing from £19.50 in 2001/02 to £11.40 in 2015/16, where figures have been adjusted for inflation. 2015/16 is the first time the weekly average amount spent on alcohol and tobacco has fallen below £12.00. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"5e3b2e75\" />\n\nWe can look at expenditure on alcoholic drinks and tobacco separately. The average weekly expenditure on alcoholic drinks in 2015/16 was £7.80. The alcoholic drinks sub-category with the largest average expenditure was wine, which made up 42% of all money spent on alcoholic drinks consumed in the home. The majority of alcoholic drink sub-categories had the same or decreased expenditure between 2014/15 and 2015/16, figures not adjusted for inflation. \n\nAverage weekly spending on tobacco in 2015/16 was £3.60; this includes £2.80 average spending on cigarettes. This is a fall of £0.30 from the 2014/15 average weekly spending on cigarettes, figures not adjusted for inflation. This decrease is likely to be caused by the continuation in the [falling numbers of smokers][9] in the UK. \n\nExpenditure on e-cigarettes was included in the sub-category of other tobacco for the first time in 2015/16. Despite this addition, average weekly spending on other tobacco remained the same between 2014/15 and 2015/16, where figures are not adjusted for inflation. This is because the introduction of e-cigarettes was off-set by a decrease in spending on other tobacco products that fall into this category, such as pipe tobacco.\n\nIt is interesting to look at the regional average weekly spending on alcohol and tobacco. We combine 3 years of data when presenting spending broken down by country and region. The average spending on alcohol and tobacco combined over financial years ending 2014, 2015 and 2016 was £11.90.\n\nAs [Table A35][10] shows, spending on alcohol and tobacco across the UK was very varied. Households in Scotland spent the most on alcoholic drinks, with an average of £8.90 a week; this is 1.8% of Scotland’s total expenditure. This was partly driven by expenditure on spirits and liqueurs, where Scottish households spent an average of £2.70 a week, compared with the UK average of £1.70. In contrast to this, London households spent 1.1% of total expenditure on alcoholic drinks. The [ethnic diversity][11] of London may contribute to the low levels of spending on alcohol in this region.\n\nExpenditure on tobacco is even more varied across the regions. The average weekly spending on cigarettes for England is £2.90, Wales £3.00, Scotland £4.90 and Northern Ireland £6.60. This clearly shows the varied picture across the UK. \n\n\n  [1]: http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=discretionary-spending\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/timeseries/lf24/lms\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2016\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/householdexpenditureasapercentageoftotalexpenditurebyageofhouseholdreferencepersonuktablea10\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/bulletins/alcoholrelateddeathsintheunitedkingdom/registeredin2014\n  [6]: http://content.digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB17526/stat-smok-eng-2015-rep.pdf\n  [7]: http://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/tobacco/docs/tobacco_liability_final_en.pdf\n  [8]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/smoking-in-vehicles\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/drugusealcoholandsmoking/datasets/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/detailedhouseholdexpenditurebycountriesandregionsuktablea35\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/ethnicity/articles/ethnicityandnationalidentityinenglandandwales/2012-12-11",

              "markdown": "In the financial year ending 2016 (2015/16), UK households spent an average of £16.00 a week on communication. This category includes spending on things such as mobile phones, telephones and postal services. UK households have spent an increasing amount of money on communication since the financial year ending 2002 as shown by Figure 9, where figures are adjusted for inflation.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"cccff652\" />\n\nAs shown in [Table A34][1], all regions spend 3% of their total expenditure on communication. Communication is the only category where the percentage of total expenditure does not vary at all between regions. \n\nIn 2015/16, over half of money spent on communication was on a mobile phone-related cost. Mobile phone ownership has dramatically increased over the last 2 decades and has overtaken landline ownership, as shown by Figure 10.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"52f7a4fb\" />\n\nFigure 10 shows that in the financial year ending 1997, only 16% of UK households owned a mobile phone. By 2015/16, this increased by 79 percentage points to reach 95%. To put this into context, 95% of UK households also have central heating, suggesting that communication devices such as mobile phones are now viewed as a necessity. \n\nAlthough the UK has seen a rapid increase in mobile phone ownership over the last 20 years, internet connection has seen an even bigger and more rapid rise. As more and more services and everyday tasks become available online, it is important that households have access to the internet. In 2015/16, of all UK households 88% had internet connection, compared with 9% of households in the late 1990s.\n\nThe percentage of households with internet connection varied across the UK, as shown in [Table A48][2]. For example, only 78% of households in Northern Ireland had internet connection, compared with 90% of households in London. It was also different across income groups, where 55% of households in the lowest income group had internet connection, compared with 100% of households in the highest income group. Although this is a large gap, it is narrowing. In 2014/15, only 51% of households in the lowest income group had internet connection. \n\nThe role of the internet is seen in other areas of household expenditure. DVD player and Blu-ray ownership has reduced from 90% in 2009 to 80% in 2015/16, suggesting that UK households are using alternate broadcast and recording methods such as TV on demand, [streaming][3] and digital recording of live TV. [Table A2][4] shows that in 2015/16, average weekly spending on online grocery shopping was £3.90, compared with £2.90 in 2014/15, figures not adjusted for inflation. This reflects the [increasing amount of goods and services bought on the internet][5]. \n\nThere is much evidence to suggest that spending in the UK has changed following the digital era experienced in recent years. However, UK households still spend money on more traditional pastimes. This includes £0.70 per week on going to the cinema, £0.80 a week on stationery and art materials and £4.60 on their pets. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/householdexpenditureasapercentageoftotalexpenditurebycountriesandregionsuktablea34\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/percentageofhouseholdswithdurablegoodsbycountriesandregionsuktablea48\n  [3]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-consumers-give-boost-to-legal-downloading-and-streaming-for-tv-films-and-music\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/expenditureonfoodandnonalcoholicdrinksbyplaceofpurchaseukfinancialyearending2016tablea2\n  [5]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rdit2/e-commerce-and-internet-use/5-facts-relating-to-web-sales/sty-5-facts.html",

The LCF is a UK household survey, designed to provide information on household expenditure patterns and food consumption.\n\nThe LCF is a voluntary sample survey of private households. Each individual in a selected household is asked to keep an expenditure diary for 2 weeks. Further information is also obtained from a household interview. The survey is continuous, interviews being spread evenly over the year to ensure that seasonal effects are covered. \n\nGreat care is taken to ensure complete confidentiality of information and to protect the identity of LCF households. Only anonymised data are supplied to users.\n\n###Sampling\n\nThe LCF sample for Great Britain is a multi-stage stratified random sample with clustering. It is drawn from the small users file of the postcode address file (PAF) – the Post Office’s list of addresses. After stratification by 2 census variables, 638 postal sectors are randomly selected and, from within these, households are sampled. \n\nA total of 11,484 households were selected in 2015/16 for the LCF in Great Britain.\n\nThe Northern Ireland sample is drawn as a random sample of addresses from the Land and Property Services Agency list. \n\n####Response \n\nGreat Britain \n\nThe overall response rate for the LCF in 2015/16 was 46% in Great Britain.\n\nBecause of the practicalities of running a voluntary survey, it is not possible to get full response from every selected household. Of the total 11,484 households in Great Britain selected for the LCF in 2015/16, there were 4,760 households that co-operated fully in the survey, including 179 households that provided sufficient information to be included as valid responses. Looking at the UK as a whole, there were 4,918 co-operating households.\n\nNorthern Ireland \n\nIn 2015/16, there were 300 sampled households, 252 of which were eligible, where 158 households gave full interviews. This gives a Northern Ireland response rate of 62%.\n\nThe [technical report][4] provides further information on response.\n\n####Estimation\n\nThe LCF employs weighting to reduce the effect of non-response bias and produce estimates of population totals and means. The weighting procedure is designed to compensate for non-response (sample-based weighting) and to adjust the sample to reflect known population totals (population-based weighting).\n\nThe [technical report][5] goes into further detail showing the effects of the weighting by comparing unweighted and weighted data from 2015/16.\n\n####Standard errors and estimates of precision \n\nThe LCF is a sample of households and not a census of the whole population. Therefore, the estimates presented in this report will differ, to some degree, from the true population values. For more information on all estimates of precision, please see the technical report.\n\nStandard errors – Standard errors provide a numerical measure of the likely difference that will arise, solely due to random chance. Standard errors for detailed expenditure items are presented in relative terms in [Table A1][6] (standard error as a percentage of the average to which it refers). \n\nConfidence intervals – Confidence intervals can be used to estimate a range within which the true population value should lie. This report presents confidence intervals at the 95% level. This means that if we used the same sampling method to select different samples and computed an interval estimate for each sample, we would expect the true population parameter to fall within the interval estimates 95% of the time.\n\nStatistical significance testing – Statistical significance testing indicates the probability with which we are confident that the difference between the estimates under examination did not occur by chance. Any significant testing carried out is at the 95% level unless otherwise stated. This means that the probability that the difference occurred by chance is low (1 in 20 or lower). \n\n####Equivalisation methodology\n\nIncome quintile and decile groups are based on a ranking of households by equivalised disposable income. Equivalisation is the process of accounting for the fact that households with many members are likely to need a higher income to achieve the same standard of living as households with fewer members. Equivalisation takes into account the number of people living in the household and their ages, acknowledging that while a household with 2 people in it will need more money to sustain the same living standards as one with a single person, the 2-person household is unlikely to need double the income.\n\nThe [Family Spending Technical Report][7] provides further detail.\n\n####Spending by region\n\nThis bulletin considers expenditure by region. We combine 3 years of data when presenting spending broken down by country and region. This is done to increase the sample size and therefore improve the robustness of results. The average for each year is summed and then the total is divided by 3. The averages used are not adjusted for inflation.\n\n####Comparisons over time\n\nThroughout this bulletin, figures are compared over time. Where possible, expenditure figures have been deflated, that is, adjusted for inflation, to allow comparison of expenditure in real terms across survey years. In this bulletin, all figures have been deflated when comparing the main classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP) categories over time. Figures not adjusted for inflation are also available for the main COICOP categories in [Table 4.3][8]. More detailed categories have not been deflated; this is stated in the commentary.\n\nFigures are deflated using the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and the indices are specific to each major COICOP category. For items that are not applicable to the CPI, for example, mortgage interest payments and Council Tax payments, the Retail Prices Index (RPI) was used. \n\nThe LCF is reviewed every year and changes are made to keep it up-to-date. Therefore, year-on-year changes should be interpreted with caution. \n\nStandard errors for categories with lower levels of spending tend to be higher, so trends for these categories need to be treated with a degree of caution.\n\nChanges and differences mentioned are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, unless stated. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/methodologies/livingcostsandfoodsurvey\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/qmis/livingcostsandfoodsurveyqmi\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/methodologies/livingcostsandfoodsurvey\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/methodologies/livingcostsandfoodsurvey\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/methodologies/livingcostsandfoodsurvey\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/componentsofhouseholdexpenditureuktablea1\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/methodologies/livingcostsandfoodsurvey\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/householdexpenditureatcurrentpricesuktable43",

In November 2016, the National Statistician published a [statement][1] confirming that the change will take place in March 2017.\n\nThe National Statistics status of CPIH was suspended in 2014. For CPIH to become a trusted measure of inflation, user engagement needs to be given priority. This report covers the approach that we have taken to build understanding and confidence in CPIH since the publication of the National Statistician’s letter in March 2016. The end of the report also sets out the future plans we have for engaging users, as it is recognised that user engagement is a continual process. \n\nAs discussed further in [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics][2], consumer price indices are used by innumerable employers, pension funds, investors, regulators, analysts, policy makers, researchers, academics and private citizens. There has been considerable interest in CPIH and a desire to understand our plans to make it our headline inflation measure, and over the past year we have made considerable efforts to expand our user engagement. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/news/statementsandletters/statementonfutureofconsumerpriceinflationstatisticsintheuk\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/usersandusesofconsumerpriceinflationstatistics",

              "markdown": "Our overall objective, which underpins all our user engagement and communication, is “for CPIH to become a trusted National Statistic that is widely understood\".\n\nTo achieve this, it is crucial for us to build user understanding and confidence in the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH). We need to take users on a journey to a position where CPIH is a trusted National Statistic, and then on towards a world where decision makers and commentators are familiar with and confident in CPIH.  We need to use every possible opportunity to communicate the rationale for CPIH, understand and address user concerns, and create a sense of momentum. \n\nWhen setting out our plans, we envisaged 3 main phases to this.\n\nPhase 1 is about building user confidence in CPIH, including understanding stakeholder concerns, through proactively establishing new user relationships and communicating developments and publications that address known user concerns about CPIH. While these activities are intended to carry on after Phase 1, this phase is expressly concerned with building user confidence to a level that would support CPIH’s redesignation as a National Statistic. \n\nPhase 2 is about preparing to formally move to CPIH as the headline measure of inflation. It is focused on getting key stakeholders up to speed with our proposals and make them prepared for the change. \n\nPhase 3 consists of an ongoing, open-ended programme of engagement to address remaining concerns about CPIH, continue to build user confidence and to embed it as a good inflation measure. This phase also focuses on raising awareness of CPIH among the general public. \n\nThe work is framed around the following engagement workstreams: \n\n-\tstrengthen the message of CPIH being the most comprehensive economic measure of inflation, highlighting examples of users taking steps to move to CPIH, and continuing to support it\n\n-\tbuild on existing relationships and create new ones, focusing particularly on users or groups of users who are less aware of the different inflation measures and CPIH in particular\n\n-\traise public awareness and understanding through targeted products, and improved engagement with the press and other public-facing organisations\n\n-\tpublish a series of articles to develop understanding of CPIH, targeting the spectrum of users from the inquiring citizen to the expert\n\n-\testablish effective engagement mechanisms with data suppliers with a focus on the Valuation Office Agency as suppliers of private rents data\n\n-\tensure user and supplier engagement activities feed into work planning\n",

Similarly, the users of these statistics are diverse in terms of what they use the statistics for, and their levels of knowledge and understanding. When considering how to engage with this varied group, the most important factors to consider are levels of interest and expertise. For this reason, we have considered our engagement activities based on the following broad categories. \n\nExpert users tend to use the statistics in their work, and have strong theoretical or applied subject matter knowledge. \n\nInformed users include individuals and organisations that regularly use consumer price inflation statistics in their work, but may not have expert knowledge.  \n\nCitizen users form the majority of the population, with varying levels of understanding of what inflation is and what it means for the economy.\n",

              "markdown": "The following sections give an overview of the work undertaken for each of the workstreams identified above, along with selected examples. \n\n###4.1\tStrengthen the message of CPIH being the most comprehensive economic measure of inflation\n\nIn order to present a clear and consistent message to users, we have framed our communications around the following key points:\n\n-\tConsumer Prices Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH) is the best economic measure of inflation because it is in line with statistical best practice (unlike the Retail Price Index (RPI)) and is more comprehensive as it includes the costs faced by owner occupiers (unlike CPI)\n\n-\ta headline measure of inflation will create a common understanding of inflation and address concerns about “index shopping”\n\n-\twe strongly discourage the use of RPI, which is methodologically unsound and want people to be aware of CPIH as a good alternative \n\n-\talthough still hotly debated, rental equivalence is the strongest approach for including owner occupiers’ housing costs from a conceptual and data availability perspective\n\n-\tthe RPI is not a good measure of inflation, nor does it have the potential to be one. We will, however, continue to publish the minimum of RPI data required to meet user needs\n\n-\tthe Household Costs Indices (HCIs) will be a valuable tool for understanding how households experience price changes; its future use will, however, depend on final design choices and its properties once developed\n\n\n###4.2\tBuild on existing relationships and create new ones\n\nWhile we have strong relationships and regular engagement with key economic policy stakeholders such as the Bank of England and HM Treasury, more needed to be done to reach users with whom we have a less structured relationship. In particular, although many users have a good understanding of the existing measures of inflation, awareness and understanding of CPIH needs to be improved. \n\nWe developed our understanding of users through an initial period of research, which has been consolidated as we have made contact with new organisations. Throughout, we have maintained a comprehensive log of engagement activities which, as well as serving as a record of user concerns, enables us to adapt our communications approach in an informed way. This information has also been used to update our ‘[Uses and users of consumer price statistics][1]’ article, which will be revisited regularly.\n\nThis section largely focuses on “informed” and “expert” users, highlighting particular examples and explaining the approaches and impact in more detail. \n\n####Example 1: Advisory Panels for Consumer Prices (APCPs)\n\nIn June 2015, the UK Statistics Authority announced the formation of  2 independent advisory panels on consumer price statistics: a technical panel to advise the National Statistician on technical aspects of the statistics; and a stakeholder panel to provide advice on the uses and applications of price indices.\n\nThe APCP (Technical and Stakeholder) have met separately 4 times in the year to February 2017, to provide advice on a number of issues pertinent to the ongoing progress of consumer price statistics in the UK. The panels focused on the reassessment of CPIH as a National Statistic, the development of HCIs, the forward work programme for consumer price statistics, and other methodological changes to consumer price statistics in the UK. The [2016 annual report][2] includes a summary of the discussions held by the panels throughout 2016, and the resulting advice.\n\n####Example 2: User events\nEvents provide an opportunity to engage directly with a large audience, and can be either ONS or user-led. Some examples of events to date include: \n\n-\ta special ONS Economic Forum event was held In February 2016 focusing specifically on owner occupier’s housing measurement, as it is one of the most controversial aspects of inflation measurement; this event covered the methodology and the data source underpinning the owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) element, including by demonstrating how our results on OOH costs tallied with private sector analysis of the rental market\n\n-\tthe above was followed up with a presentation at a general ONS Economic Forum in April 2016 to reach a wider audience, and again in January 2017\n\n-\twe worked with the RPI/CPI User Group to develop an event, held on 12 September 2016; by user demand, the focus was on the HCIs (then Index of Household Payments)\n\n-\tmany government departments use these statistics, and Heads of Profession are an important point of influence; a member of Prices Division presented to the Heads of Profession group on 27 September 2016\n\n-\ton 23 January 2017 we presented at a meeting of the Bristol Actuarial Society\n\n-\tthe National Statistician and the Chief Economist will be attending an RPI/CPI User Group event in February 2017; this will provide a further opportunity to engage with users\n\n-\twhen meeting with representative groups and umbrella organisations we have offered to present more widely to their members; we expect this to be taken up over the coming months, for example, in May we will present at a conference of regulated industries \n\n-\ton 21 November 2016 we hosted a joint user event with the UK Regulators Network (UKRN), attended by roughly 35 representatives from various economic regulators\n\n\n####Example 3: Umbrella organisations and networks\n\nEngagement with umbrella organisations is an effective and resource efficient way to reach a wider community. Engaging with these organisations serves to strengthen the messages, and draws on their expertise in communicating with their audience.\n\nWe presented to staff from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and in November 2016 we held a joint event with the UK Regulators Network (UKRN) to discuss CPIH and the use of inflation measures in economic regulation. \n\nWe have also reached out to other groups such as the Trade Unions Congress (TUC), who we met in October 2016, and the Pensions and Lifetimes Saving Association (PLSA) with a view to exploring how we might engage their members. \n\n####Example 4: Other targeted engagement\n\nThrough developing and maintaining our knowledge of the user community, we have been able to target our engagement activities to where they will have the greatest impact. Through building relationships with these organisations, we have been able to identify and address their main concerns.\n\nOfwat are in the process of moving away from RPI, and will consult on which measure to move to in 2017. We have met twice with their staff, focusing on timescales. This has enabled them to structure their own engagement activities to enable a smooth transition to a new measure.\n\nWe have worked extensively with the Debt Management Office to help communicate clear messages and provide reassurance to the financial markets. They have also assisted us by gathering feedback from the markets, which has in turn informed our strategy for future communications, particularly around clarity over which RPI indices will be discontinued.\n\nActively monitoring the media and online channels has enabled us to target engagement where we know that there is a concern or misconception. \n\nIn addition we have willingly engaged with users who have contacted us seeking an update. \n\n####Example 5: Consumer prices newsletter\n\nAugust 2016 saw the launch of the Consumer Price Statistics newsletter. The mailing list is taken from the Prices Stakeholder Database, and is supplemented with additional known contacts. In total the newsletter is sent to around 600 people.  \n\nAs well as serving to publicise the latest results, articles and events, the newsletter provides an opportunity to present our messages about CPIH and for users to provide feedback.\n\nFurther editions were published in November 2016 and January 2017, in particular drawing attention to the publication of the CPIH compendium and other articles referred to later in this document. \n\n####Example 6: Engagement with the RPI/CPI User Group\n\nThe RPI/CPI User Group operates through a combination of events and meetings, and an active online community on StatsUserNet. The User Group has previously expressed its sense that its concerns have not been given due attention. Regular meetings with the Chair were therefore established to discuss specific concerns, and agree further engagement. Between March 2016 and January 2017, our representatives have also attended the group’s committee meetings, and presented at an event on the HCIs. John Pullinger will present at a user group event on 24 February, covering the future of consumer price inflation statistics.\n\nWe have strengthened our engagement on StatsUserNet, with several of our staff regularly posting, and producing additional analyses in response to feedback. \n\n###4.3\tRaise public awareness and understanding \n\nGiven the widespread interest in inflation, it is also important that we target efforts at the “inquiring citizen”. This can be achieved both through producing tailored products, and through effective engagement with the media and other organisations which have strong links to the citizen user. A key issue is ensuring that the media report our plans accurately. \n\n####Example 1: Engaging with the media\n\nImmediately following publication of the National Statistician’s letter to Sir Andrew in March 2016, the Director General for Economic Statistics briefed key journalists. The letter received an accurate portrayal in the media with a clear emphasis on the proposal for CPIH to eventually become the headline measure of inflation. \n\nA similar ring-around was conducted in November 2016 upon publication of a further letter from the National Statistician. A member of Prices Division appeared on Share Radio to discuss CPIH, and the Director General for Economic Statistics took part in a discussion on BBC Radio 4, helping us reach a large audience. Again, most of the coverage was accurate. \n\nBoth announcements gained much attention on social media. For both announcements there were some critical voices, but there was also much neutral and informative coverage, particularly after the second announcement. \nA summary of the media and social media reactions to these announcements was logged and analysed to inform future engagement. \n\nA summary of the media and social media reactions to these announcements was logged and analysed to inform future engagement. \n\n####Example 2: Engaging with other public-facing organisations\n\nSome organisations have a strong, direct link to the citizen user, and provide an opportunity to engage this group. Future engagement will coincide with the move to CPIH as our headline measure.\n\n####Example 3: Developing targeted products\t\n\nOur website affords us with the ability to publish material that is more appealing to non-expert users, for example on our corporate blog and the [Visual.ONS site][3]. We recently published [a blog][4] on the choice of method for measuring owner occupiers' housing costs, and we will explore further options.\n\n###4.4\tPublish a series of articles to raise awareness and understanding of CPIH\n\nA range of products has been produced for different audiences that aim to raise awareness of CPIH, explain the rationale for methodological decisions, and to provide comparisons with other measures and approaches. These include:\n\n-\ta CPIH [compendium][5] was published on 28 October 2016. In recognition of the fact that material relating to decisions taken on CPIH was spread across various articles; this was shared on StatsUserNet, and included in the November edition of the consumer prices stakeholder newsletter, and circulated to key stakeholders groups\n\n-\t[Consumer price indices: a brief guide][6] gives basic information on consumer price indices including CPIH\n\n-\t[Uses and users of consumer prices inflation statistics][7] details the known uses of the indices\n\n-\t[The Consumer Price Inflation Quality and Methodology Information page][8] provides a first port of call for methodological information, and gives a non-technical overview of the indices and their applications\n\n-\t[Quality assurance of administrative data used in CPIH][9] informs users of the quality of administrative data used in producing the index\n\n-\t[Comparing measures of private rental growth in the UK][10] compares the Index of Private Housing Rental Prices to other measures of private rental growth\n\n-\t[Understanding the different approaches of measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs][11] is a quarterly article that compares the main approaches to measuring OOH, which is still a heavily debated area\n\n###4.5\tEstablish effective engagement mechanisms with data suppliers \n\nAn [assessment of the data sources used in the production of CPIH][12], using the Quality Assurance of Administrative Data (QAAD) toolkit, has been produced. This includes a comprehensive assessment of the communication procedures with all data suppliers, and will allow the producers, supplier and users of the statistic to understand the data processing and associated risks. It also details quality assurance and communication procedures for non-administrative data. \n\nA review of administrative data procedures within Prices Division as a whole is being conducted following the above review. This lists several recommendations for improving the acquisition, application and handling of administrative data, including improving the engagement mechanisms with suppliers and the SLAs/contracts.\n\nWe have placed particular emphasis on strengthening our relationship with the Valuation Office Agency, as providers of data for owner occupiers’ housing costs. A Service Level Agreement has been put in place, supported by a regular schedule of meetings covering performance and future plans.\n\n###4.6\tEnsure user and supplier engagement activities feed back into work planning\n\nAlong with expert knowledge, the engagement activities detailed above have been used to inform the development of a [Consumer Prices Work Programme][13]. This has been presented to both the stakeholder and technical advisory panels, which were both supportive of the overall coverage, and provided feedback on the relative priorities. This consultative approach will be used going forward, to ensure that the workplan evolves with emerging user needs. When presenting the plan to the panels, we have the opportunity to highlight wider user demand to inform the panels’ views on priorities.\n\nThroughout the work on improving CPIH, our engagement with users has helped us gauge the level of understanding and identify particular concerns in the user community, which in turn has helped inform the content and emphasis of the articles and products we have produced. \n\nSpecific recent examples of where user feedback has influenced our planning include:\n\n-\tchanges to the methodology used to collect clothing prices made in 2010 had a significant impact on the “formula effect” gap between CPI and RPI. Further investigation of this was given a low priority, but following significant user demand through the advisory panels and the RPI/CPI User Group, it has been moved to a higher priority\n\n-\talthough not specific to CPIH, the proposal to develop HCIs was in response to user demand. We have since worked closely with experts in the user community who proposed the index to develop the concept further\n\n-\tthe “spotlight” section of [Understanding the different approaches of measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs][14] allows us to respond to user requests for additional analysis\n\nAs detailed in the previous section, the supplier engagement activities centre on assessing performance and developing plans. The review process for SLAs also provides a focal point for engagement to feed into planning.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/usersandusesofconsumerpriceinflationstatistics\n  [2]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Advisory-Panels-for-Consumer-Prices-2016-Annual-Report.pdf\n  [3]: http://visual.ons.gov.uk/\n  [4]: https://blog.ons.gov.uk/2017/01/10/including-housing-costs-in-measures-of-inflation/\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/cpihcompendium/2016-10-13\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/consumerpriceindicesabriefguide/2016\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/usersandusesofconsumerpriceinflationstatistics\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/qmis/consumerpriceinflationqmi\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/owneroccupiershousingcostsincpihqualityassuranceofadministrativedatadec2016\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/comparingmeasuresofprivaterentalgrowthintheuk/octtodec2016\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcosts/quarter3julytosept2016\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/qualityassuranceofadministrativedatausedincpih\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/consumerpricesdevelopmentplan/2016-10-11\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcosts/quarter3julytosept2016#spotlight-owner-occupiers-housing-costs-in-the-rpi",

Whether through direct engagement or by working through umbrella groups, we have focused on building user awareness of and confidence in CPIH as a measure of consumer price inflation. We have taken proactive steps to reach a broader audience, including through launching a newsletter that is circulated to around 600 users and developing content for digital channels. \n\nIt is clear that not all users agree with the methodology behind CPIH, and some concerns have been raised. However, through a mixture of publications and discussion with users, we have clearly set out our rationale for how the measure is constructed and how we quality assure data. We will continue to engage users going forward on these and any other concerns that they may arise. \n\nThere is still some way to go until CPIH is a widely understood measure. We believe however that with continued user engagement and active communication this will come in time. There are already encouraging signs of progress, and these represent an important step towards the measure’s wider adoption. Regaining National Statistics status is a priority, and a number of users have suggested is a prerequisite for considering its adoption. We recognise that it might take some time for that awareness to be gained. The next step is making CPIH the headline measure of inflation and the focus of our statistical bulletins in March 2017. We expect this  to increase its profile, and we will continue to work with users to address concerns and support its use.\n",

              "markdown": "In the UK, work to develop a measure of owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) has taken place over many years. There have been three phases to the development of OOH; notably the initial development of OOH in the Retail Price Index (RPI), the move towards incorporating OOH into an expanded measure of Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and the development of new private rental indices, and the revisions to these private rental indices following further research into the source data.\n\n###A.1 Development of owner occupiers’ housing costs in RPI\n\nThe Retail Prices Index (RPI) became the main measure of inflation in the UK in the late 1950s, an evolved version of the Cost of Living Index which had been published by the government on an ongoing basis since 1914. This used the rental equivalence approach to measure owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). The RPI continued to be developed under the scrutiny of the Retail Prices Index Advisory Committee (RPIAC). \n\nThe rental equivalence method was retained for a number of years and, in 1962, and again in 1968, the committee recommended that the rental equivalence approach should continue to be used. However, later, in 1975 the method for calculating OOH was reviewed by RPIAC and changed. The reasons for this were due to criticisms that “house buyers have been very conscious of rising prices and mortgage interest rates” and that “rented housing and owner-occupied housing are now distinct housing markets” ([Retail Prices Index Advisory Committee, 1975][1]). Of course, the housing market today is very different to the market in 1975, and so it would be unwise to refer back to this decision as justification for a particular treatment of OOH costs today. Our rationale for the use of the rental equivalence approach in CPIH is presented in section S1.2.\n\nThus, mortgage interest payments were included for the first time in 1975. This was broadly consistent with a payments approach. In 1994, however, the method for calculating OOH costs was again reviewed following concerns over the direct use of interest payments and the erratic nature of year-on-year movements. This time a use approach, known as an “accounting approach”, was decided upon. This simply added a component of depreciation to the existing measure, to account for provision made for deterioration and obsolescence of the dwelling. \n\nThere was not universal agreement on the best method to use. The majority of committee members supported a payments approach, but acknowledged the concerns, and supported the modification of the OOH measure to an accounting approach. A number of committee members, however, were in disagreement and produced minority reports for the 1994 annual report. Among those who accepted the majority report, the accounting approach was not necessarily their first preference. Some had serious reservations about retaining mortgage interest payments and accepted the accounting approach as the only sensible way forward, given the lack of support for other methods among the committee.\n\nFor more information on RPIAC’s discussions on OOH costs, please refer to the [RPIAC historic reports][2].\n\n###A.2 Development of CPIH and corresponding private rental indices (2009 to 2013)\n\nFollowing the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, EU member states were required to develop and publish a Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). In 2003, we changed the name of UK HICP to the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). By this point, the main gap in the HICP was a measure of OOH. However, the pace of European development was not fast enough to meet UK users’ needs and we decided that it should aim to incorporate OOH into an expanded measure of CPI independently of Europe. Therefore, in 2009, the development of OOH was prioritised, guided by the Consumer Prices Advisory Committee (CPAC)^1^. In July 2009, at its first meeting, CPAC was introduced to OOH concepts^2^ and over the next 3 years CPAC helped guide us in our development of owner occupiers’ housing costs. The decision to move ahead of Europe to develop OOH was welcomed by UK stakeholders and it also became a [commitment][3] of the coalition government in 2010. \n\nInitially all four approaches to OOH were considered by CPAC. In September 2010 CPAC [recommended][4] that future development work on OOH should focus on the net acquisitions and rental equivalence approaches. As well as focusing on the statistical arguments for and against the different approaches, CPAC considered the use that the index could be put to, notably as an inflation target in the Bank of England’s monetary policy regime. \n\nThe payments approach was discarded as the inclusion of interest payments would be at odds with an index used for inflation targeting, that is if interest rates were raised to control inflation, this would increase mortgage interest payments, which would impact directly on the level of inflation. In addition, interest payments capture the cost of borrowing money, rather than the cost of services provided by owner-occupiers’ housing. Including interest payments in an index is counter to the idea that inflation should not capture the value of assets as they are not consumed in the same way as good and services. CPAC also concluded that the narrow user cost method was not a suitable approach due to the subjectivity involved in selecting the methodology for determining and changing the real rate of interest, an important component in calculating the opportunity cost of home ownership. The UK Statistics Authority Board supported CPAC’s recommendations and made the development of OOH a top priority for us.\n\nOver the next 18 months, we undertook a work programme to develop robust OOH indices using the rental equivalence and net acquisitions approaches. At the time private rental data were collected from letting agents in 141 locations throughout the UK, for use in calculating the actual rentals series in the suite of consumer price statistics. In each location, rental prices for six furnished and six unfurnished properties were collected once a quarter. In developing the rental equivalence method, we determined this source of private rental data was not suitable for a measure of OOH using the rental equivalence approach. This position was supported by a commodity review^1^ we conducted in late 2009 and work by the international HICP Implementation Group of Quality Adjustment and Sampling^2^ which identified a need to improve the quality of the private rents series. In March 2011^3^ We reported to CPAC that it had identified three possible sources of private rental data: \n\n- Valuation Office Agency (VOA) for England, and comparable data from the Scottish and Welsh Governments\n- Rentright.co.uk\n- Acadametrics\n\nAt this meeting, CPAC concluded that VOA rental data for England offered the most promising possibility for improving the measurement of private rents. In order to carry out its statutory functions, VOA’s Rent Officers collect actual (and not advertised) prices; a substantial database of rental prices existed from 2005 onwards with full address and detailed property attributes. However, VOA is an executive agency of HM Revenue and Customs, and so rental price data held by VOA are subject to the Commissioners of Revenue and Customs Act 2005 (CRCA). The legislative position of the VOA rents data is unusually complex, as Rent Officers were transferred from the Department for Work and Pensions to VOA in 2009, after CRCA was enacted. At this point there was no change to the legislation to integrate their functions within CRCA, particularly with regards to the data held. Therefore, no gateway currently exists to allow VOA to share the micro level data with us. As a result, a compromise was reached, whereby statisticians in ONS and VOA worked together to develop a method for calculating private rental indices and to implement this in VOA’s systems. This means that the processing of England rental data is entirely consistent with the processing of rent data for Scotland and Wales (where no such legislative barrier exists), which is carried out by us directly.\n\nIn early 2012, we completed a mapping exercise of requirements for a private rental series (the full results of this exercise are presented in Annex B). In particular, it had to be suitable for producing OOH using the rental equivalence approach. VOA data (plus comparable data from the Welsh and Scottish governments) were deemed a better match to the requirements compared with the existing data, primarily because the data source had a much larger sample and contained information on property type and number of bedrooms, allowing for additional stratification. However, it was acknowledged that there were no formal procedures in place for rent officers to follow up properties, which presented a challenge. This meant that an assumption had to be made about the length of time a property remained valid and at the time a decision was made to assume that rental prices remain valid for 18 months, unless there is an update before then. The assumption was based on a report from the Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA), which stated that 71% of tenancies last between 13 and 24 months^4^. Criteria were developed for replacing properties no longer available with a comparable replacement where possible. \n\nIn April 2012, a final update was presented to CPAC^5^ on the development of the new private rental price index. CPAC noted that the new index was better suited to the measurement of rental equivalence and agreed that it should be stratified by region, property type and furnished/unfurnished status to create a mix-adjusted index that can be weighted to reflect either the owner occupier housing sector or private rental sector. Through the remainder of 2012 the production of the new private rental price index was refined. This included a quality assurance process and refinements to the matching key and replacement strategy. \n\nCPAC was also asked to advise on which measure of OOH should be included in an expanded CPI (called CPIH)^6^ at the April 2012 meeting. CPAC were asked to choose between the net acquisitions and rental equivalence measures (having previously rejected the payments and narrow user costs measures at the September 2010 meeting). To assist with the decision making process, CPAC requested that we prepare a list of questions for members to consider before providing their advice. Therefore, we prepared a number of questions and answers (described in Section S1.2) that provided a set of quality criteria for CPAC to consider when making its decision. At this meeting, CPAC recommended that the rental equivalence approach should be used to measure OOH in CPIH, making this recommendation for the following statistical and use-based reasons:\n\n- a better match against the quality criteria (as set out in Section S1.2) for a measure of OOH in CPIH\n- the exclusion of the asset price from the measure\n- quality of the underlying data source (based on the mapping exercise presented in Annex B)\n- consistency with the measurement of imputed rents in the National Accounts\n- suitability for the purpose of determining monetary policy and for compensation uprating, were the government to decide to put CPIH to those uses at some point in the future\n\nDuring summer 2012, we launched a [public consultation][5]. In responding to the consultation, users were asked to consider the following question: \n\n“Does the recommended method, which uses the rental equivalence approach for reflecting owner occupiers’ housing costs in a new additional measure of consumer price inflation, best meet your needs?”\n\nIn September 2012 CPAC was asked to consider whether its recommendation, that the rental equivalence approach should be used to measure OOH in CPIH, was still appropriate in light of responses from the consultation. Briefly, these were that:\n\n- users views were split evenly between those who favoured rental equivalence, those who favoured net acquisitions, and those who favoured neither\n- those who supported rental equivalence did so for similar reasons to those put forward by CPAC, as well as its relative smoothness, and its simplicity\n- there were some concerns that long-term growth rates were lower than for other approaches, and that the use of an administrative data source could be subject to change and discontinuity\n- those who supported net acquisitions were concerned with the use of a proxy measure, and that this measure did not appear to capture house price booms and busts, and felt that consistency with national accounts was not relevant\n- some supporters of net acquisitions recognised that the inclusion of asset prices makes it less suitable for monetary policy; others felt that capital value movements were appropriate for measuring consumption of goods and services\n- of those users who supported neither the net acquisitions or rental equivalence measures, the payments approach was generally favoured, with others having no strong view\n\nOn balance, CPAC felt that no new issues were raised by the consultation and therefore confirmed its recommendation that the rental equivalence approach should be used to measure OOH in CPIH7. All CPAC papers considered in developing OOH are listed in Annex C.\n\nThe National Statistician concluded that she would review the arguments for each approach before arriving at a recommendation for the UK Statistics Authority. A key consideration in the National Statistician’s review was the quality of the private rental data available, and the impossibility of removing the asset price element from the net acquisitions measure. Therefore, in September 2012 the UK Statistics Authority Board accepted the National Statistician’s recommendation to implement rental equivalence as the method for reflecting OOH in CPIH. \n\nCPAC ceased operations in 2013, with its final meeting being held in January of that year. Despite CPAC providing valuable support to Prices Division within ONS, there were a number of weaknesses to the process:\n\n- confusion around whether CPAC was an advisory body or a decision-making body\n- a confounding of technical issues, with questions on the purpose or use of price statistics\n- membership was dominated by economists and government representatives\n- some external users felt that CPAC papers should be made available publicly before the committee was held\n\nOf course, none of these weaknesses invalidate the advice that was given by CPAC. \n\nSubsequently, the governance processes were reviewed by Professor Sir Adrian Smith (2014) in his [Review of the governance of prices statistics][6] (which also contains more detail on CPAC’s weaknesses). This recommended the creation of 2 Advisory Panels for Consumer Prices (APCP) – a Technical Panel and a Stakeholder Panel. These panels have been in operation since January 2016.\n\nIn early 2013, the new private rental price indices were introduced into the suite of consumer price inflation statistics to measure private rental prices. CPIH was assessed for National Statistics status (see Box 3) during the first half of 2013 and the resulting [assessment report][7] was published in July 2013. Following the implementation of the assessments requirements, CPIH was [granted National Statistics status][8] on 21 November 2013. The new private rental price indices also enabled the publication of the Index of Private Housing Rental Prices (IPHRP) which was launched in June 2013.\n\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <td>Box 3: Statistics Status<p>\nThe Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 defines ‘official statistics’ as all those statistical outputs produced by government departments and Crown bodies. ‘National Statistics’ are a subset of official statistics which have been certified by the UK Statistics Authority as compliant with its Code of Practice for Official Statistics. ‘Experimental Statistics’ are series of statistics that are in the testing phase and not yet fully developed.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nA pictorial representation of the timeline for developing OOH and CPIH is available in Figure 3.\n\n<ons-image path=\"9351e375\" />\n\n###A.3 Revisions to the private rental price indices and CPIH (2014 to current)\n\nFollowing the launch of CPIH in March 2013, and IPHRP in June 2013, a number of users questioned the different price evolution shown by the new private rental price indices when compared with other sources of information on average private rental prices. In particular, users made comparisons between the private rental price indices and VOA’s Private Rental Market Statistics (PRMS) which are based on the same underlying rental data collected by VOA rent officers. We subsequently initiated work with VOA to understand these differences and to determine whether any improvements were possible to the methods used to aggregate the rental data in our measures. In August 2014, the methodological review carried out by ONS and VOA estimated that improvements would result in revisions of up to 0.2 percentage points on the headline CPIH index and, following an exchange of letters between John Pullinger, the National Statistician, and Sir Andrew Dilnot, Chair of the UK Statistics Authority, on 14 August 2014, the National Statistics designation of CPIH was [suspended][9], returning the indicator to experimental status (see Box 3). This decision was taken because of required improvements to the comparable replacement of properties, rather than a problem with the rental equivalence approach. \n\nThere were four areas identified for improvement:\n\n- improvements to the process for determining comparable replacement properties when a price update for a sampled property becomes unavailable, leading to more viable matches\n- bringing the process for replacing properties for which there is no comparable replacement into line with that used for other goods and services in consumer price statistics\n- optimising the sample of properties used at the start of the year, to increase the pool of properties from which comparable replacements can be selected\n- reassessing the length of time for which a rent price can be considered valid before a replacement property is found\n\nAn article, [Improvements to the measurement of owner-occupiers’ housing costs and private housing rental prices][10], published in January 2015 analyses and quantifies the impact of each of these improvements separately. The aggregate impact of these improvements on OOH and IPHRP indices are presented in Figures 3-5 below. For OOH (Figure 4), the average annual growth rate since January 2012 (the post recession period), is 1.5 percent, an increase of 0.5 percentage points on the previously published series. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"c191eb3e\" />\n\nThe revisions to the annual growth rates show that IPHRP for Great Britain (Figure 5) was under estimating rental price inflation by an average of 0.9 percentage points across the period. At the regional level, the improvements led to an upward revision (on average) in the annual growth rates for all regions, the revisions in London being the largest with an average upward revision of 1.8 percentage points (Figure 6).\n\n<ons-chart path=\"c8ff23e7\" />\n\n<ons-chart path=\"ce8e9ee4\" />\n\nIn addition, the article ‘Improvements to the measurement of owner occupiers’ housing costs and private housing rental prices’ explores alternative sources of private rents data and analyses their growth rate against IPHRP. Differences can be attributed to a number of factors:\n\n- average rental prices published by private companies with an interest in the rental market usually base their measures on new lets made within the reference month\n- there is an important difference between newly let properties and existing tenants; price rises are highest when properties are newly let compared with existing tenants renewing a lease\n- initial evidence was also presented to show that average rental prices were likely to include compositional and quality changes which are excluded from private rental price indices; for example, there are now more new properties in the rental market which tend to generate higher rents, suggesting they are of higher quality\n- on the other hand, the average size of rental properties had declined marginally\n- at present, the trend in quality is unclear, but average rents could be driven up where quality is increasing\n\nThe impact of compositional changes is easier to measure and in September 2015, compositional changes at the local authority level were quantified in the paper [Explaining private rental growth][11]. Using VOA data, the paper shows that differences in growth between the private rental price indices and VOA PRMS statistics since 2010 can be largely attributed to compositional changes in the private rented sector, in particular in London. Overall, the sample average rent grows by around 35% between 2010 and 2015, 11% of this can be explained by index growth while an additional 17% is explained by changes in the composition of the sample between years at the local authority level. This is because more rental properties in more affluent areas are now included in the sample. The impact of this is to increase average rents measure, however these effects are intentionally excluded from a price index measure that compares “like with like”.\n\nConsumer price indices are rarely revised (and the RPI is never revised). Improvements to the private rental price indices were implemented in the OOH component in CPIH and IPHRP in early 2015 with revisions back to 2005. As CPIH was being revised, this presented a unique opportunity to also revise the OOH weight in CPIH so that it is aligned with historical National Accounts estimates and reflected, as far as possible, [planned changes][12] to the methodology for measuring imputed rents that have been introduced in Blue Book 2016. The revisions are described in the article [Revising the weight of Owner Occupiers' Housing in CPIH][13].\n\nIn September 2015, the re-assessment of CPIH as a National Statistic commenced and on 3 March 2015 the [Assessment Report][14] was published. The report contains 10 requirements and we are expected to report to the UK Statistics Authority by September 2016 on the actions that it has taken to address these requirements, with the exception of Requirement 6. Following these improvements, the UK Statistics Authority expects that there will be a prolonged period of time where we monitor CPIH closely, to fully understand the trends in the index over time compared to other sources, before it can present robust assurance to users about its credibility as a measure of inflation. Requirement 6 of the assessment report reflects this need.\n\n#####Notes for Annex A: Development of owner occupiers’ housing costs in the UK:\n\n1. CPAC existed from 2009-2013.

              "markdown": "This compendium aims to provide users with a comprehensive and accessible source of information on the Consumer Prices Index, including owner-occupiers’ Housing costs (CPIH). This compendium will focus chiefly on the measurement of owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). For more information on other items in CPIH, please see the [Consumer Price Indices - Technical Manual][1]. \n\nThe CPIH is identical to the UK’s headline measure of inflation, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), save for the treatment of OOH costs, which are excluded from the CPI. The CPI came into existence in the late 1990s, and is identical to the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) which is produced for Eurostat according to European regulations. It replaced the Retail Price Index (RPI) as the headline measure of inflation in 2003. The RPI was de-designated as a National Statistic in 2013 due to the use of an unsuitable formula in the construction of the index. RPIJ was introduced in 2013, and was identical to the RPI, save for the use of a more appropriate formula to replace the unsuitable one. Therefore, RPI and RPIJ share many common flaws, such as population coverage, and treatment of OOH costs. The CPIH, which compensated for the lack of a measure of OOH in CPI, was introduced in 2013. OOH are a major part of household budgets and, as such, are an important aspect of consumer price inflation. As the more complete measure, then, it is intended that CPIH should in due course become the headline measure of consumer price inflation in the UK. \n\nThis view is supported by [UK Consumer Price Statistics: A Review][2] (Paul Johnson, 2015; commonly referred to as the Johnson Review) and, following an open consultation, in the [National Statistician’s letter][3] to the chair of the UK Statistics Authority on 9 March 2016, he indicated that this should happen once CPIH has been re-awarded its designation as a National Statistic. The CPIH was de-designated in 2014 after required improvements to the methodology were identified. We submitted our evidence to the UK Statistics Authority on 26 September 2016. The evidence contains a suite of new and updated publications, which will be used over a period of time to monitor the behaviour of the index, and increase awareness and confidence in CPIH. We hope for CPIH to be awarded National Statistic status in the first half of 2017 \n\n###Measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs\n\nOwner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) costs are the costs associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. This is distinct from the cost of purchasing a house. A consumer price index aims to measure consumption, whereas the purchase of a house is the purchase of an asset that is not consumed in the same way as other items. Moreover, OOH costs can be measured when they are paid for, when they are acquired, or when they are used. This means that we have to identify an appropriate target. OOH costs are therefore challenging to measure. There are several ways in which this might be done. These methods are all subject to practical and theoretical limitations and, as such, there is unlikely to be a consensus on the best approach.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Put simply, rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as an estimate of the cost of housing services. This answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner-occupier. In other words, we value housing services by looking at the cost of the next best alternative to home ownership, namely renting a property: “if I did not own a home, I would need to rent one”. Rents are therefore a proxy for the cost of home ownership. Importantly, the rental equivalence approach does not capture changes in asset value; rather it measures the change in price of housing services provided.\n\nThe other approaches of measuring OOH are:\n\n- The payments approach, which measures what households pay directly when consuming housing; this includes mortgage interest payments, transaction costs and running costs such as major repairs.\n- The narrow user costs approach, which estimates each of the individual elements of the costs of the services; these include mortgage interest payments and the cost to the owner occupier of having money tied up in their dwelling rather than being used for some other purpose, plus depreciation and recurring costs such as maintenance.\n- The net acquisitions approach, which measures only price changes for houses which are new to the household sector; the house price is disaggregated into land (asset) and dwelling (consumable) costs, and the land is then excluded from the measure – There is also some measure of the maintenance of the property included.\n\nWe prefer the rental equivalence method because it has the strong advantage of not including asset prices. This means that it is suitable as a measure of consumption. The measure is also underpinned by a good quality source of data that allows it to be reliably estimated. It is consistent with the methodology used in the national accounts and, for those countries we have researched, rental equivalence is the most common method among those who include a measure of OOH in their headline CPIs. Some users have argued that this method is not easily understood, and that OOH costs should be measured directly.\n\nThe payments approach, however, is not suitable because of the inclusion of interest. This is essentially the cost of borrowing money, and is not consumption. Further, the narrow user costs approach can give very different results depending on subjective choices made in its construction. \n\nThe choice between net acquisitions and rental equivalence is less clear. Whilst net acquisitions is consistent with Eurostat’s methodology and the principles on which the CPI is built, and seems to tally better with some user’s expectations of housing costs, data limitations mean that the price of land cannot be stripped out. This means that the net acquisitions measure contains some element of asset prices. On balance, therefore, the rental equivalence approach is the best approach to incorporate OOH costs into CPIH.\n\nBecause of the difficulties inherent in measuring OOH by any method, it is unlikely there will be agreement among all users on the best approach. Nevertheless, the potential of the rental equivalence measure to more accurately reflect the consumption costs of owner occupiers is greater and, as such, is our preferred method of measuring this item. The National Statistician’s Consumer Prices Advisory Panel (CPAC) [recommended this approach][4] in 2012, and this view is supported by the [Johnson Review][5] (2015). We will continue to address user’s concerns through this Compendium, as well as supplementary articles such as [Understanding the different approaches of measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs][6].\n\n###Constructing the rental equivalence measure\n\nThe rental equivalence measure is constructed using data on private rents collected by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) in England, by Rent Officers Wales in Wales and by Rent Service Scotland in Scotland, for the purposes of administering Housing Benefit and Universal Credit functions. Northern Ireland rent prices are currently collected as part of the wider Consumer Prices Index (CPI) price collection, but we are currently investigating the potential of data from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive to improve the sample.\n\nA random sample is selected from the data for different property types in each of Wales, Scotland and the nine regions of England^1^. The unsampled data are used as a substitution pool to identify comparable replacement prices when properties drop out of the sample. We use the Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland microdata to compile private rental price indices for these regions, and VOA provide us with the indices for England directly using the same methodology. We have worked with VOA to ensure that methods and systems are robust, and have put appropriate service level agreements (SLAs) in place. \n\nThe private rental price indices are then rescaled according to expenditure in the owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) market (that is, stratum weights are applied), and combined to form the OOH component of CPIH. The expenditure data are derived from counts of owner occupied housing provided by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). These counts (or dwelling stock data) are only available nationally, so each property type is given equal weight in all regions. Dwelling stock data are multiplied by average prices to derive expenditure. \n\nNational Accounts OOH data are used to create OOH expenditure weights. These weights are then used to combine the OOH component with other items to form the headline index. This is consistent with the treatment of other items in the CPI basket of goods and services^2^.\n\n###Quality of the OOH measure\n\nThe rental equivalence measure of owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) costs is underpinned by large, good quality sources of rental data in England, Scotland and Wales, which are collected by rent officers for the purposes of administering housing benefit functions. Northern Ireland data are based on the normal Consumer Prices Index (CPI) collection and, as such, the sample is rather small; however, We are currently exploring a new source of data for private rents that will be comparable to those used in Britain. Moreover, we do not have access to the microdata for England. To maintain the integrity of the index, we have worked closely with the supplier to develop systems, and ensure that a consistent methodology is applied. Service level agreements (SLAs) have been put in place to ensure the continued supply of data. \n\nThe data provide a large representative sample of the UK rental market. Whilst the sample is not random (rent officers are given a target number of rental prices to collect, however the data are provided on a voluntary basis, and the sampling frame of the market is unknown), rent officers use their market knowledge to ensure that the prices collected are representative of the rental market in that area. This is similar to the procedure used by price collectors for the CPI. To ensure that the rental data are representative of the OOH market stratum weights are used, as described above. Difficulties with following rental properties over time are mitigated by only sampling half the properties in January, and using the remaining properties as a substitution pool, again described above.\n\nThere are other issues that, should they occur, would introduce a potential bias into the rental equivalence measure. For example, should the government introduce rental controls, rental equivalence may no longer be an appropriate measure for OOH costs, although it is thought that this is unlikely to happen. Government policy to increase home ownership may cause the rental sample to fall, although this would be balanced against the fall in home ownership seen since the economic downturn in 2008. Finally, should the administrative requirements for housing benefit change, the data may no longer need to be collected. SLAs are in place to ensure that we will be notified in advance of any such changes, allowing us to plan accordingly.\n\n###Future work\n\nAs the intended headline measure of consumer price inflation, CPIH is an important and potentially influential statistic. We are committed to maintaining the quality of the index, as well as continuing its ongoing programme of development for the index, and monitoring the index’s behaviour over time. This will include:\n\n- a comparison of the rental equivalence measure with other measures of OOH, which will be published in the quarterly article [Understanding the different approaches of measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs][7], and will allow us to assess the performance of the measure over time\n- monitoring the sources of rental data used to construct the rental equivalence measure against other potential sources of rental data, to ensure that the current source continues to be the best measure of rental prices (to be published alongside the [Index of Private House Rental Prices][8] (IPHRP) on a monthly basis)\n- reviewing Quality Assurance of Administrative Data (QAAD) documentation on an annual basis, and other important documentation, such as the [Users and Uses][9] paper, and this Compendium, will be updated as required \n- development of the OOH index, through improving the source of rental data for Northern Ireland and the regional breakdown for dwelling stock data\n\nThis work is important to ensure the future success of CPIH, and to help establish it as the leading measure of consumer price inflation in the UK, with the intention of it becoming the headline measure once it has been awarded National Statistic status some time before mid-2017. We welcome feedback on the development of CPIH from users, who can get in touch with us through the following channels:\n\nEmail: <cpi@ons.gsi.gov.uk>\n\nAddress: Christopher Payne, Prices Division, Office for National Statistics, Cardiff Road, Newport, NP10 8XG\n\n#####Notes for Executive summary\n\n1.

              "markdown": "This compendium aims to provide users with a comprehensive and accessible source of information on the Consumer Prices Index, including owner occupiers’ Housing costs (CPIH). In particular, the compendium will focus on the measurement of Owner Occupiers’ Housing costs (OOH), and its inclusion within CPIH. For more information on other elements of CPIH, please see the [Consumer Price Indices - Technical Manual][1]. The compendium will cover three main areas. Section S1 sets out the rationale for our choice of method, compared against other measures of OOH. Section S2 details how the OOH measure is constructed, and Section S3 considers potential areas of concern with the measure. The paper [Users and Uses][2], which gives more information on what CPIH and other measures of inflation in the UK are used for and who are they are used by, may also be a useful accompaniment to the compendium.\n\nThe CPIH is one of a suite of measures of UK consumer price inflation that we currently produce.. The headline measure is the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). The CPI is the same as the UK’s Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), which is produced for Eurostat, and is designed as a consistent measure of inflation across members of the European Statistical System (ESS). Thus the CPI follows international best practice. As the headline measure, CPI is used for inflation targeting as well as uprating pensions and benefits. \n\nThe CPIH is identical to CPI with the additional inclusion of a measure of owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). OOH costs are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. These costs represent a large proportion of consumption expenditure and, as such, are an important addition to the basket of goods and services. OOH measures do not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains are generally defined as being out of scope of any kind of consumer price index. This is because they are an investment in an asset, and so add to household wealth, rather than spending on consumption. In conjunction with the Land Registry, Land and Property Services Northern Ireland, and Registers of Scotland, we also produce a House Price Index, which measures the change in cost of housing directly.\n\nOOH costs in CPIH are measured using the rental equivalence method, which uses the rent of a similar property as a proxy for the cost of owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. This method was [recommended][3] by the National Statistician’s Consumer Prices Advisory Committee (CPAC) in 2012. The CPIH is not currently a National Statistic. It was de-designated after required improvements to the comparable replacement of properties were identified. These improvements have now been made, and protocols put in place to ensure the continued supply of accurate data. \n\nIt is a drawback of the CPI that it does not include OOH. Therefore, following the recommendations of [the Johnson Review][4] (2015) and the subsequent consultation, the National Statistician, in his [letter][5] of 9 March 2016, recommended that “CPIH should become the ONS preferred measure of consumer inflation and the focal point of ONS commentary… [once] CPIH is re-accredited as a National Statistic.”\n\nOther consumer price statistics include the Retail Prices Index (RPI) which, due mostly to the use of a formula which does not meet international standards, is no longer a National Statistic. It continues to be produced as it is tied to long-term contracts, including the indexation of index-linked gilts. The RPIJ, is the same as RPI, but replaces the unsuitable formula with a more appropriate one. For more information on the RPI and the RPIJ, please see the [Consumer Price Indices – Technical Manual][6].\n\nAs the intended headline measure of inflation, CPIH is an important and potentially influential statistic. This document sets out valuable information to users on the rationale behind and construction of the OOH component of CPIH.\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices---technical-manual/2014/index.html\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/usersandusesofconsumerpriceinflationstatistics\n  [3]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/who-ons-are/programmes-and-projects/other-development-work/consumer-prices-advisory-committee--cpac-/index.html\n  [4]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports-and-correspondence/reviews/uk-consumer-price-statistics-a-review/\n  [5]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/shaping-the-future-of-consumer-inflation-statistics-in-the-uk/\n  [6]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices---technical-manual/2014/index.html",

In all other respects the CPIH is identical to CPI and, for more information on non-OOH items; the [Consumer Price Indices – Technical Manual][1] should be consulted. This first section introduces the concept of OOH costs, describing what they are and how they can be measured. The rationale behind the choice of the rental equivalence approach is then described, with a focus on the limitations of each of the measures, and how they are constructed in practice.\n\n###S1.1 Overview of owner occupiers’ housing costs\n\n####S1.1.1 What are owner occupiers’ housing costs? \n\nOOH are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. This encompasses the shelter and security the home provides. This is distinct from the value of a home as an asset, and the associated capital gains. While some believe that the change in asset value holds a place in the measurement of consumer price inflation, this view is not accepted in the international community.\n\n####S1.1.2 Why is measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs so difficult? \n\nDetermining how best to measure OOH is one of the most contentious issues in the field of inflation measurement. The reasons for this stem from both methodological and practical considerations. There are a number of different ways in which OOH might be measured, each with methodological strengths and weaknesses. \n\nIn constructing a measure of inflation a decision must be made on the point at which to observe price change. There are three choices: the point of acquisition of a good or service, the point at which it is used, or the point at which it is paid for. For most goods and services, this makes little to no difference. For example, an apple would generally be acquired, paid for and used (eaten) in the same period (month). For a number of goods and services, it could make some difference. These differences are at their largest when considering OOH. Owner-occupied housing is acquired at a single point, used for many years and can be paid for (for example, through a mortgage) over much of a lifetime. This means that, for OOH costs, depending on when we choose to observe price change, we will be measuring a different target.\n\nPrices in CPI and CPIH are, for the most part, collected on an acquisitions basis. The [Eurostat Detailed Technical manual on owner-occupied housing][2] suggests that the acquisition approach to measuring OOH costs is consistent with an index that aims to measure inflation. The use approach, on the other hand, is more consistent with the idea of a cost of living index^1^, whereas the payments approach is appropriate for evaluating monetary income. In a similar vein, in 2003, international experts at the 17th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) passed a resolution on the importance of determining whether the purpose of the index is best met by the acquisition, use or payment approach. It recognises that practical difficulties may make it necessary to use a mix of approaches, in particular for measuring OOH costs. \n\n####S1.1.3 What are the approaches to measuring owner-occupiers’ housing costs? \n\nStatisticians and economists have developed theoretical methods to measure OOH from each of these perspectives. Thus, each of these approaches is measuring a different target.  Each method is summarised in Table 1 below.\n\n<table border=1; valign=\"top\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Method  </th>\n    <th>Target  </th>\n    <th>Approach  </th>\n    <th>Description  </th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Payments   </td>\n    <td>The payments relating to the ownership of OOH  </td>\n    <td>Payments  </td>\n    <td>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Directly measures what households pay as owner occupiers when consuming housing.</li>\n\t\t<li>Includes mortgage interest payments, transaction costs and running costs.</li>\n\t</ul>\n     </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Net acquisitions   </td>\n    <td>The cost of acquiring and maintaining OOH  </td>\n    <td>Acquisitions  </td>\n    <td>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Treats a house as the purchase of a good that is part asset (the land) and part  consumable (the house).</li>\n\t\t<li>Includes costs associated with buying and maintaining a house, for example major repairs, transfer costs and dwellings insurance.</li>\n\t</ul>\n     </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Rental equivalence (user costs)  </td>\n    <td>The ongoing consumption of OOH services  </td>\n    <td>Use  </td>\n    <td>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Assumes a dwelling is a capital good and therefore not consumed, but instead provides  a flow of services that are consumed each period.</li>\n\t\t<li>Rental equivalence imputes owner occupiers’ housing costs from the rents paid for equivalent rented properties.</li>\n\t</ul>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Narrow user costs  </td>\n    <td>The ongoing consumption of OOH services  </td>\n    <td>Use  </td>\n    <td>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Assumes that a dwelling is a capital good, and therefore not consumed, but instead  provides a flow of services that are consumed each period.</li>\n\t\t<li>Estimates are made for each of the individual elements of the costs of the services.

The relevant sections have been reproduced below.\n\n###Net acquisitions\n\nMeasuring cost at the point a house is acquired gives rise to the net acquisitions approach. This treats a house as a purchase of a good that is part asset, part consumable. The “net” part refers to the fact that only properties that are bought from outside the household sector are included, with sales to other sectors netted off. This is because sales between households are transfers and leave the household sector no better or worse off. \n\nThe distinction between asset and consumable is represented by considering the building itself (and spending on the property, such as maintenance) as the good being consumed, and the land it stands on as the asset. As the asset element is excluded from a consumer price index, this ideally requires separate information about land and house building prices. In total, the net acquisitions approach therefore includes:\n\n- net purchases of dwellings by the household sector (excluding land prices)\n- self-built housing\n- alterations and additions\n- transaction costs (such as taxes and legal fees)\n- running costs (such as repairs and maintenance, insurance)\n\nWe currently produce an experimental net acquisitions index for Eurostat. Eurostat has developed the net acquisitions methodology for potential inclusion in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), an inflation measure that EU member states must produce in line with European regulations. This ensures that the inflation measure is consistent across the economic area. We have worked with Eurostat to ensure that the UK’s net acquisitions method is in line with its methodology.\n\n###Payments approach\n\nThe second approach is the payments approach. It is defined by looking at what households pay out as owner occupiers (excluding … capital payments). This includes:\n\n- mortgage interest payments (MIPS)\n- transaction costs\n- running costs (such as repairs and maintenance and insurance)\n\nMortgage interest payments are usually regarded as within the scope of the payments approach. This in itself makes the payments approach unsuitable for many purposes, such as inflation rate targeting and, arguably, the uprating of benefits.\n\nTransaction costs include estate agency fees and conveyancing. Stamp duty is also arguably a transaction cost, although it is excluded from the Retail Price Index (RPI), which is sometimes said to follow a payments approach.\n\nRunning costs include spending on repairs and maintenance, house insurance and ground rent. Accounting for major repairs – those that go beyond restoring a house to its initial state – poses another problem for the payments approach. These are a significant but irregular part of the costs of owning a home. They are difficult to obtain prices for on a consistent basis, and one needs to disentangle upkeep from alterations which improve the property (and are hence are a form of investment).\n\nIt is generally accepted … that houses are a combination of an asset and a consumable good. The various methods of measuring the costs of owner occupiers that exist all acknowledge this distinction in some way and try to disentangle the two, with the goal of excluding the asset element. In the context of the payments approach, this is achieved by excluding payments that create an asset (or reduce a liability) on household balance sheets. These include down payments, the capital element of mortgage repayments, and alterations and additions to the property.\n\n###Narrow user cost approach\n\nThe user cost approach is a use-based approach; that is, it aims to measure the cost of using housing. It treats housing as a capital good that provides services that the owner occupier consumes. The user cost approach measures the costs of owning the house, which are a combination of the actual expenses incurred (for example, repairs and maintenance) and the costs of financing the purchase of the property.\n\nThe full user cost model is: \n\nFull user cost = Mortgage interest paid<br>\n+ Interest forgone on capital used (opportunity cost)<br>\n+ Depreciation<br>\n+ Running costs (repairs and maintenance, taxes, insurance etc.)<br>\n- Capital gain (difference between price at beginning and end of period)\n\nWe considered a narrow user cost approach in 2010. The model that we developed was: \n\nNarrow user cost = (Average house price × real rate of interest)<br>\n+ Depreciation<br>\n+ Running costs (repairs and maintenance, taxes, insurance etc.) \n\nThe first term assumes that the sum of mortgage interest and opportunity cost can be represented by the “real rate of interest”. This is intended to represent the real return (that is, excluding inflation) of a long-term investment.\n\n###Rental equivalence\n\nThe rental equivalence approach is, like the user cost approach, a use-based approach. It treats housing as a capital good that is not itself consumed; instead, it provides a service that the owner occupier consumes. The rental equivalence approach argues that people who own their home can either live in it or rent it out. Therefore, the rent the owner-occupier could have received is a measure of how much these services are worth. \n\nThe rental equivalence approach measures the forgone value of these services using private rents of comparable properties. The rent charged by landlords covers not just the property but many of the other costs borne by owner occupiers, such as repairs and maintenance and transaction costs. Therefore, under the rental equivalence approach, these are not estimated separately, as to do so would introduce double-counting.\n\nFor rental equivalence to work, the rental market needs to be large enough to function, excluding controlled rents. It also requires that privately-rented properties can represent owner-occupied properties. In other words, there need to be enough properties of each type, in each part of the country, to construct a rent price index, weighted for the composition of the owner occupied sector.\n\nRental equivalence also requires that the houses available for rental are representative (subject to adjustment for property mix) of those in the owner occupied sector.\n\nThe rental equivalence method, therefore, uses the rent paid for an equivalent house in the private sector as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner-occupier. It would, however, be a false comparison to try to equate rental equivalence costs with those faced by owner occupiers buying in today’s market. The net acquisitions approach, for instance, measures only the costs faced by purchasers from other sectors (principally new housing). The rental equivalence approach covers all owner-occupiers, not just those who are buying from other sectors. Rental equivalence prices are based on price changes in the private rental market, which will be influenced by movements in today’s house prices but will also reflect historic price changes. Rental equivalence is the method currently used to measure OOH costs in CPIH.\n\n###S1.2 The rationale for using the rental equivalence method in the UK\n\nAs a consumer price index, CPIH is a measure of the cost of consumption. Therefore the choice of method for measuring OOH should be based on the most statistically accurate method for measuring the changing cost of consumption goods and services in the UK. This means that asset prices should not be included, as an asset is not consumed in the way that goods and services are.\n\nIn short, our preferred method for measuring OOH costs is the rental equivalence method. Rental equivalence is the best approach because:\n\n- the exclusion of asset prices makes it more appropriate as a measure of consumption\n- the underlying data are of good quality (based on the mapping exercise presented in Annex B), and allow the measure to be reliably estimated\n- rental equivalence is consistent with National Accounts methodology and is widely used internationally\n\nThis decision was arrived at by consideration of each of the measures, both in terms of their theoretical appropriateness, and how they are measured in practice. \n\nGiven that we aim to measure the cost of consumption, we have decided against the payments approach, because of the inclusion of mortgage interest payments. Interest payments capture the cost of borrowing money, rather than the cost of services provided by owner-occupiers’ housing. Including interest payments in an index is counter to the idea that we aim to measure the cost of consumption, as they are not consumed in the same way as goods and services. \n\nMoreover, the household sector will benefit from interest received (for example, through savings) as well as lose out through interest paid. The treatment of such items in CPIH is usually to capture the net expenditure; for example, with insurance we take insurance payments and remove the claims received to arrive at an aggregate expenditure for the household sector. Paul Johnson, in his [review of consumer price statistics][4], suggests that a payments measure of OOH costs “is only appropriate when compared to a measure of household income”.\n\nThe narrow user cost method is also not a suitable approach, because of the subjectivity involved in selecting the methodology for determining and changing the real rate of interest, an important component in calculating the opportunity cost of home ownership. [Previous research (CPAC(10)02)][5] has shown that this method is particularly sensitive to the choice of real rate of interest. Moreover, this method can result in negative index values.\n\nThe choice therefore reduces to a decision between the net acquisitions and the rental equivalence approaches. The choice between these two measures is less clear, and the arguments for both require careful evaluation. We will therefore consider them against the following questions, which are aligned to the [quality dimensions][6] which the Government Statistical Service adhere to. CPAC used a similar argument when it [advised the National Statistician][7] in 2012 on the best approach for measuring OOH costs. For more detail on the history of OOH costs in UK price indices, please see Appendix A.\n\n####S1.2.1 Can the approach be easily understood by the public?\n\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Quality dimension</th>\n    <td align=\"center\">Accessibility and clarity</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Preferred measure</th>\n    <td align=\"center\">Net acquisitions</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nThe net acquisitions method can be briefly described as “measuring the costs associated with purchasing and maintaining a house”. Most users understand the concept, though some are unclear of the rationale or rightness for attempting to remove the asset element of the house price, or only considering properties new to the household sector. \n\nThe rental equivalence method can be briefly described as “‘measuring the price owner-occupiers’ would need to pay to rent their own home”. Many users find this a harder concept to grasp than net acquisitions. Some users also question the link between the rental and owner occupiers’ housing markets.\n\nIn truth, measuring OOH is a complex problem and none of the methods are straightforward.\n\n####S1.2.2 Can the approach be produced in time to be included in the CPI?\n\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Quality dimension</th>\n    <td align=\"center\">Timeliness</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th >Preferred measure  </th>\n    <td align=\"center\">Net acquisitions<br>Rental equivalence</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nAll components of the net acquisitions approach are timely except the house price and stamp duty components which are lagged by one month. All components of the rental equivalence approach are timely except the English rental data. The English rental data is lagged by at least one month. \n\n####S1.2.3 Is the method consistent with the European Union method for measuring OOH, and international best practice for measuring OOH?\n\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Quality dimension</th>\n    <td align=\"center\">Comparability</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Preferred measure</th>\n    <td align=\"center\">Rental equivalence</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nWhilst Eurostat consider that rental equivalence is not suitable for inclusion in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the main reasons for this are that HICP principles exclude the use of imputation (which rental equivalence and user costs approaches both make use of), and that rental equivalence is invalid where countries do not have a sufficiently large rental market to produce an accurate measure of rental equivalence. However, CPIH does not need to be consistent with HICP principles, as it is being developed for UK purposes and, as such, the primary consideration should be best meeting the needs of UK users of consumer price statistics. The UK has a well-established rental market, and a rich source of rental data. The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) collects around 500,000 rental prices annually for England, for the purposes of administering housing benefit functions. Similar data are collected in Wales and Scotland by the devolved authorities. The data are described in more detail in Section S2.\n\nThe OOH method developed by the European Statistical System for potential future inclusion in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices follows a net acquisitions approach. We have worked with Eurostat to ensure that the UK’s net acquisitions measure is in line with this method. Due to the fact that many member states are unable to separate the land and building costs for dwellings which are newly acquired, or new to the OOH sector, Eurostat instead requires house prices to be measured, using the national House Price Index (HPI). It is necessary to ensure comparability across countries that may or may not be able to price the land and buildings elements separately (such as the UK).\n\n####Table 2: International approaches to

however, based on [our research][8], the rental equivalence measure (or a similar use-based approach) is the most common among countries currently operating an inflation targeting regime. In fact, exclusion is the most common approach; however, by definition, CPIH aims to include OOH costs. For example, the USA’s Consumer Price Index includes rent of the primary residence and owners’ equivalent rent of the primary residence as the two main components classified under Shelter. Other notable examples include Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany and Norway. Where countries operate an inflation-targeting regime with a net acquisitions measure of OOH in their target index, the asset element of the price is not included. Australia and New Zealand, for example, use the net acquisitions approach but they are able to price a dwelling structure independently from the plot of land. Table 2 lists the measures of OOH used in the headline measure of inflation for various countries.\n\n####S1.2.4 To what extent does this approach meet the range of different user needs?^2^\n\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Quality dimension</th>\n    <td align=\"center\">Relevance</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Preferred measure</th>\n    <td align=\"center\">Rental equivalence</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nMany users expect a measure of OOH to move in line with house prices. The impact of increasing house prices on the net acquisitions approach tallies with many users expectations. However, in the UK, it is impossible to disentangle the asset element from the consumption element. This is because it is not possible to separate the land and building costs for dwellings which are newly acquired, or new to the OOH sector. Instead, the House Price Index is used to measure house prices. Hence this measure includes asset prices which, as discussed, are at odds with a measure of the cost of consumption. This would make the measure less suitable for some uses such as inflation targeting to determine monetary policy. Indeed, whilst house price bubbles may be a concern for users, house prices do not need to be included in the measure of inflation for monetary policy to address the issue. The Monetary Policy Committee considers a wide range of indicators when setting monetary policy. The House Price Index (HPI) can be used to assess and monitor house price inflation.\n\nOn the other hand, the rental equivalence measure reflects just the consumption cost of OOH, making it suitable for this purpose. Further, as the rental equivalence method belongs to the family of use-based methods, which are conceptually closer to the cost of living concept than net acquisitions, this would be more appropriate for compensation uprating.  Some users, however, have expressed a concern about the lack of an obvious link between the rental equivalence measure and changes in house prices^3^.\n\n####Table 3: Criteria for assessing the accuracy of OOH measures\n\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th colspan=\"2\">Criterion</th>\n    <th>Standard</th>\n    <th>Net Acquisitions</th>\n    <th>Rental Equivalence</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Definition and aim of the index</td>\n    <td>Measure price changes through monetary transactions of consumption goods and services</td>\n    <td>&#10003; Measure price changes through monetary transactions of<br>  consumption goods and services</td>\n    <td>&#10007; Measure price changes through non-monetary transactions of consumption goods and services</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Geographical coverage<br>  </td>\n    <td>All owner occupied housing in the United Kingdom<br>  </td>\n    <td>&#10003; All owner-occupied housing in the United Kingdom<br>  </td>\n    <td>&#10003; All owner-occupied housing in the United Kingdom<br>  </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Conceptual basis of expenditure weights<br>  </td>\n    <td>Household Final Monetary Consumption Expenditure<br>  </td>\n    <td>&#10003; Part of Gross Fixed Capital Formation and Household Final Monetary Consumption Expenditure<br>  </td>\n    <td>&#10007; Function of owner-occupied dwelling stock and average level of private rent<br>  </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td rowspan=\"3\"><br>  Prices<br>  </td>\n    <td>Price concept</td>\n    <td>Full transaction price  </td>\n    <td>&#10003; Full transaction price  </td>\n    <td>&#10007; Imputed transaction price</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Source</td>\n    <td>Either suppliers of the good or service, purchasers of the good or service, or regulatory authority governing the good or service</td>\n    <td>&#10003; Suppliers of the good andregulatory authority</td>\n    <td>&#10003; Price movementtaken from average of movements for equivalent dwellings in rental stock.Rental stock data supplied by regulatory authority</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Timing</td>\n    <td>When financial liability is first incurred</td>\n    <td>&#10003; When financial liability is firstincurred</td>\n    <td>&#10003; (Imputed) when financial liability isincurred</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Treatment of land prices<br>  </td>\n    <td>Excluded<br>  </td>\n    <td>&#10007; Included as part of the HPI only<br>  </td>\n    <td>&#10003; Excluded<br>  </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Treatment of non-monetary expenditure<br>  </td>\n    <td>Excluded<br>  </td>\n    <td>&#10003; Excluded<br>  </td>\n    <td>&#10007; Included<br>  </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Treatment<br>of non-consumption expenditure</td>\n    <td>Excluded</td>\n    <td>&#10007; Included</td>\n    <td>&#10003; Excluded</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"2\">Adjustment<br>for quality change</td>\n    <td>Account<br>for changes in mix of dwellings, age of dwellings and dwelling characteristics</td>\n    <td>&#10003; Account<br>for change in mix of dwellings</td>\n    <td>&#10003; Account<br>for change in mix of dwellings</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"5\">&#10003; indicates that the measure meets the standard, &#10007; indicates that it does not</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n####S1.2.5 How well does the index represent changes in OOH costs?\n\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Quality dimension</th>\n    <td align=\"center\">Accuracy</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Preferred measure</th>\n    <td align=\"center\">Rental equivalence</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nWith respect to accuracy, we consider each measure in relation to the key concepts we are attempting to measure (Table 3). Both measures meet most of the criteria. For net acquisitions, the criteria that have not been met relate to the inclusion of an asset price (that is, the cost of land) in the price component of the measure, whereas, for rental equivalence, the criteria that have not been met relate to the use of imputed prices. Imputation is, however, already used elsewhere in the CPI, albeit to a lesser extent; for example, to calculate the base price when a non-comparable item is introduced. Moreover, as a measure of consumption, it is important that asset prices are not captured in the index.\n\nIt is theoretically possible for the weights for existing dwellings new to the household sector (one of the component indices of the net acquisitions measure) to be negative. This can occur, for example, when the expenditure on existing dwellings sold to the household sector is less than that of existing dwellings sold by the household sector; in other words, the stock of existing dwellings owned by the household sector is falling. In practice it is not feasible to construct a consumer price index using a negative weight. Moreover, the way the index is constructed also means that we could see counter intuitive movements. For example, we might see house prices falling but the index increasing.\n\n####S1.2.6 Is the approach consistent over time and geographical area?\n\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Quality dimension</th>\n    <td align=\"center\">Consistency</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Preferred measure</th>\n    <td align=\"center\">Net acquisitions</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nThe methods used to construct the rental equivalence indices are broadly consistent across geographic area, although there are some differences in the way the data are collected in the different constituent countries of the UK. By contrast, all data sources used in the construction of net acquisitions indices are consistent over geographic area and will be consistent going forward.\n\n####S1.2.7 Does the approach follow the same trends as other relevant measures? (For example, is the approach consistent with national accounts deflators?)\n\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Quality dimension</th>\n    <td align=\"center\">Coherence</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Preferred measure</th>\n    <td align=\"center\">Rental equivalence</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nThe System of National Accounts (SNA) treats housing as an investment asset which provides a flow of dwelling related services. The cost of consuming those dwelling related services is measured using a rental equivalence approach (known as imputed rents). The net acquisitions approach is therefore inconsistent with the approach used in the national accounts, whereas the rental equivalence measure is similar in methodology, although it has shown less volatile movements over the last fifteen years. We have harmonised the measurement of private rental prices and imputed rents for OOH in consumer price inflation statistics and the national accounts using the new private rental data source developed for CPIH.\n\nUntil 2010, the net acquisitions measure has generally risen quicker than the national accounts deflator for imputed rentals. Both series demonstrate similarly timed peaks of inflation, although the national accounts deflator didn’t show the large drop seen in the net acquisitions approach in 2008. Therefore the net acquisitions measure demonstrates limited comparability with the national accounts.\nFor a more detailed understanding of how the rental equivalence approach compares to the net acquisitions and payments approach over time, please see the [Understanding the approaches of measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs][9] article, which will be updated on a quarterly basis. \n\n####S1.2.8 Summary\n\nThere are clearly arguments for and against both approaches, and the choice is not a clear one. On balance, we have to place more weight on some arguments than others. We do not want a measure that includes asset prices, because this means it is not suitable as a measure of the cost of consumption, and therefore is of limited use, notably for inflation targeting. The rental equivalence approach is therefore a better match against the quality criteria specified in Table 3. Moreover, the underlying data source is of good quality, allowing us to produce a reliable measure of OOH, unlike the net acquisitions approach, where the data sources do not allow us to reliably separate out the asset cost (the land) from the consumption element. Finally, whilst not the primary concern, the rental equivalence approach also has the desirable property of being consistent with the approach taken in the national accounts.\n\nThis choice is supported by the [Consumer Prices Advisory Committee (CPAC)][10] which, in 2012, also recommended using the rental equivalence approach (see Annex A), and [the Johnson Review (2015)][11], which recommended that we should continue to use this approach to measure OOH costs.\n\nMore information on the development of OOH measures in UK consumer price indices can be found in Annex A. We also publish a [quarterly article][12] which monitors the development of the different approaches to measuring OOH costs.\n\n#####Notes for Section 1: The rationale for rental equivalence:\n\n1. A cost of living index is an index which accounts for consumer substitution.\n2. For more information on Users and Uses of consumer price statistics, please see [Users and Uses][13].\n3. The spotlight analysis presented in the article [Understanding the different approaches of measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs][14] suggests that, although there can be short term divergences, which can occur for a wide range of different factors, it is reasonable to expect there to be a relationship between house prices and private rents in the long term.\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices---technical-manual/2014/index.html\n  [2]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/272892/272983/Detailed_Technical_Manual_on_Owner-Occupied_Housing-v2.pdf/4ccf3133-2309-4316-b7fc-db3b89011b76\n  [3]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports-and-correspondence/reviews/uk-consumer-price-statistics-a-review/\n  [4]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports-and-correspondence/reviews/uk-consumer-price-statistics-a-review/\n  [5]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/who-ons-are/programmes-and-projects/other-development-work/consumer-prices-advisory-committee--cpac-/index.html\n  [6]: https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/statistics/quality/\n  [7]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/who-ons-are/programmes-and-projects/other-development-work/consumer-prices-advisory-committee--cpac-/index.html\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/coveragedifferencesbetweentheharmonisedindexofconsumerpricesandnationalconsumerpricesindices/2016-05-23\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcosts/quarter2aprtojune2016\n  [10]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/who-ons-are/programmes-and-projects/other-development-work/consumer-prices-advisory-committee--cpac-/index.html\n  [11]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports-and-correspondence/reviews/uk-consumer-price-statistics-a-review/\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/owneroccupiedhousingcostsusingthenetacquisitionsapproach/latest\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/usersandusesofconsumerpriceinflationstatistics\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcosts/quarter2aprtojune2016",

              "markdown": "Having established that the rental equivalence method is the preferred method for measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) costs, we now turn to how the measure is constructed for inclusion in UK consumer price indices. We begin by describing the sources of rental data used for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. We then discuss how these data are compiled into an index for OOH costs, and how the OOH index is then aggregated into headline CPIH. For completeness, we also describe how the net acquisitions measure of OOH is constructed for Eurostat.\n\n###S2.1 Collection of private rentals data\n\nPrivate rents data are collected separately in England, Scotland and Wales by rent officers as part of their responsibilities to administer functions relating to Housing Benefit and Universal Credit. This includes the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) and Local Reference Rent (LRR) schemes^1^. In all administrations, rent officers collect rental prices from agents and landlords who are willing to provide data. The sample is not random but procedures are in place to ensure the collection is representative of the private rental market. Other costs associated with renting are not collected, but are likely to be a small part of the total costs. These items are typically not rental costs and their price movements will be based on the representative item in the basket used to reflect their expenditure class.\n\nTable 4 summarises the data collection for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as their historic availability, which differs by country. Where data are not available private rents data collected as part of the ongoing CPI local price collection^2^ are used (for unfurnished rents only, as furnished rentals are not appropriate for rental equivalence). Further details on the collection for each country are provided below. The rental data are used to produce the OOH component of CPIH, as well as the Index of Private House Rental Prices (IPHRP), which measures the change in price of renting residential property from private landlords. Please see also the Quality Assurance of Administrative Data (QAAD) document for further information on the quality of the data sources. For further information on the data requirements and how our chosen sources match these, please see Annex B. [A comparison of our sources of rental data with other sources][1] is available, and are published on a monthly basis.\n\n####Table 4: Historical availability of data for OOH\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Year</th>\n    <th>England</th>\n    <th>Scotland</th>\n    <th>Wales</th>\n    <th>Northern Ireland</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2005</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"10\">VOA<br><br>Approximate annual sample of 500,000</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"6\">CPI</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"4\">CPI</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"10\">CPI</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2006</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2007</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2008</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2009</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"6\">Rent Officers Wales (Housing Policy Division, Welsh Government)<br><br>Approximate annual sample of 25,000</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2010</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2011</td>\n    <td rowspan=\"4\">Rent Services Scotland (Community Analytical Services Division, Scottish Government)<br><br><br>Approximate annual sample of 30,000</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2012</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2013</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2014</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n####S2.1.1 England\n\nThe collection of private rents in England is administered by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), using evidence of rents paid in the private rented sector. Collection results in a very large source of private rental data that is representative of the private rental market, although information is provided to rent officers on a goodwill basis.\n\nLandlords and letting agents provide VOA rent officers with data pertaining to the properties they let. Annually around 500,000 prices are now collected. This information is captured electronically in the VOA’s lettings information database. Checks are carried out at the point of entry to ensure that any Housing Benefit funded tenancies are excluded from this database. All the lettings information is provided on a goodwill basis.  \n\nVOA instructs their rent officers to ensure that the letting information that they collect is representative of the full range of local market rents in each Broad Rental Market Area (BRMA). Prices are collected from landlords, letting agents and tenants, with the aim to collect approximately 15% of data from sources other than letting agents. To ensure a representative sample, rent officers in VOA are given targets to collect rental data in each area sufficient to represent at least 10% of the private rental market based on the 2011 census. Rent officers are expected to maintain a high standard of knowledge of the private rental market in their area and over time the collection has been refined using local market knowledge to reflect the changing rental market. This combined approach of regular and targeted collection based on market intelligence results in a representative sample across each area. For more information on ensuring the quality of the data please refer to the QAAD.\n\nRent officers are alerted, via a quarterly report, of properties that are about to reach a 12-month anniversary since their last update. However, there is no formal procedure for VOA rent officers to revisit previous properties and, as a result, some properties may drop out of the sample. \n\nVOA rents data are available from 2005 onwards. However, the introduction of the LHA in 2008 resulted in changes to collection practices. As a result of these changes, the sample used to construct private housing rental indices grew from around 95,000 in 2008 to around 195,000 in 2010. The LHA is much more transparent and open to scrutiny than LRR. With its introduction there was a need for rent officers to compile and maintain a robust and representative sample of the private rental market. Dedicated teams of rent officers were formed to specialise in data collection. Guidance, training and monitoring methods were reviewed, which included introducing more effective and consistent approaches to following up data, and an effort was made to improve the awareness of the rent officers’ role. This helped create a more receptive environment to data collection. \n\n####S2.1.2 Scotland \n\nRental data for Scotland are currently provided by Rent Service Scotland, part of the Community Analytical Services Division (formally known as the Rent Registration Service) of the Scottish government. It is responsible for gathering rental prices and analysing local rental markets to provide Scottish Local Authorities with LHA figures. This information on the rental market is collected by market rental evidence teams, which are in regular contact with landlords and letting agents. Annually around 30,000 prices are collected. As well as setting the LHA figures, it provides advice to Local Authorities in assessing claims for Housing Benefit made before 7 April 2008 under the LRR scheme. Rent Service Scotland also undertakes Fair Rent valuations for regulated tenancies which began in Scotland prior to 2 January 1989. The service operates from three offices in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee and employs 12 Scottish government staff. \n\nRent officers use their knowledge and experience to ensure that data collected reflect the mix of properties in the area as far as possible. Rents are gathered from a diverse range of sources, principally internet listings, but, unlike England and Wales data, are mainly based on advertised, rather than achieved, rents. All information collected is from open market sources, never from landlords who advertise to people on housing benefits, intermediate/mid-market rents and/or halls of residence. Data for Scotland are available from 2011. All the lettings information is provided on a goodwill basis.  \n\n####S2.1.3 Wales\n\nRent Officers Wales, part of the Housing Policy Division of the Welsh Government provide rental data that are used to construct the Wales estimate. Residential accommodations in the private rented sector in Wales are valued by rent officers who provide an independent and impartial valuation service of residential properties. The market rental evidence team of Rent Officers Wales are in regular contact with landlords and letting agents who provide them with the latest up-to-date information, on a voluntary basis, to ensure all valuations are based on current open market rents.\n\nRent Officers Wales came in to existence in 2003 when it was amalgamated from eight separate regions in Wales and brought under the Welsh Government. Rent officers were first appointed in 1967 to administer Fair Rents but in 1989, when rents were de-regularised, additional functions were added whereby rent officers assessed rents for which housing benefit was being claimed.  Evidence of market rents has been collected since then. Systems and methodology were radically updated in 2008 to take account of the commencement of LHA meaning that data for Wales are available from 2009 onwards. Annually around 25,000 prices are collected.   \n\n####S2.1.4 Northern Ireland\n\nIn 2012, when the private rental indices were first developed, the Northern Ireland administrative data were deemed unsuitable because they were neither frequent nor timely enough for inclusion within a measure of consumer price inflation, and the coverage of the data only included the Belfast Metropolitan area, rather than the whole of Northern Ireland. Therefore the existing CPI private rental data collected in Northern Ireland are used when a UK aggregate is needed. For more detail on validation procedures and collection practices, please see the [Consumer Price Indices – Technical Manual][2]. \n\nThe Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE), responsible for collecting private rental data, is currently undertaking a programme of development to improve the timeliness and extend the coverage to the whole of Northern Ireland. Recent work by NIHE has looked at combining data from PropertyNews.com with NIHE rent data gathered by staff in order to calculate the LHA received for the administration of private sector housing benefit. We have been working with colleagues at the NIHE to identify what data are available and NIHE has recently provided ONS with a historic dataset which will be used to investigate if the data can potentially be used to calculate comparable private rental indices. In the future these could then be used in OOH and the IPHRP.\n\n###S2.2 Sampling strategy \n\nThe England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland data described above are then compiled into an OOH index by drawing a stratified random sample from different regions and property types. Half of the data are sampled, and the remaining half are used as a substitution pool, from which comparable replacements are drawn. Property prices remain valid for 14 months, and if no update is made during that period, a comparable replacement property is drawn from the substitution pool. If a comparable replacement property cannot be found, a non-comparable replacement is made, and a new base price is imputed. More detail on the sampling strategy is given in the following sections.\n\n####S2.2.1 Sample selection\n\nA stratified random sample^3^ is selected from across the UK each January using half of all records collected over the previous 14 months. For example, the January 2016 sample includes prices for properties collected from December 2014 to January 2016. Within this process, duplicate records for the same property are removed so that the most recent record collected is used. Prices to rent a single room in a house in multiple occupancy (HMO) are also removed. The sample, therefore, will give a stock measure of rental prices; that is, both new and existing rentals are accounted for. This is in line with international best practice, although the [Johnson Review][3] (2015) points to recent research that suggests a flow measure may be worth considering; that is, only new lets. \n\nThe total sample count for the UK in 2016 was around 300,000. This sample is drawn in January and remains fixed throughout the year. Sample counts by region and property type for 2016 are presented in Tables 5 and Table 6 respectively. The remaining records form what is referred to at the substitution pool (see Section S2.6). The size of the substitution pool will fluctuate from month to month as old properties drop out of the data and new properties come in.\n\n####S2.2.2 Stratification\n\nThe process of stratification ensures that we capture any variation between strata. The data are stratified by Wales, Scotland and the nine regions of England. Each of these strata are then further stratified by property type, and then by whether the property is furnished or unfurnished. The property types used for stratification have been chosen to reflect the characteristics a consumer would consider when purchasing or renting a dwelling and are as follows:\n\n- detached House\n- semi-detached House\n- terraced House\n- flat or maisonette\n\nStratification results in 88 strata (11 regions multiplied by four property types multiplied by two furnished statuses). Whilst the sample is subdivided into many strata, the sample size in each stratum remains large, with the smallest sample size being 719, for a detached house in London. \n\nFor the purposes of calculating owner-occupiers’ housing costs, only unfurnished properties are used, as furnished properties are not representative of the OOH market. Unfurnished properties account for nearly 90 per cent of the sample.\n\n####Table 5: Rental price sample counts by region\n\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>  Region   </th>\n    <th>  Sample count   </th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>  North East   </td>\n    <td>  12,800   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>  North West   </td>\n    <td>  33,300   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>  Yorkshire and The Humber   </td>\n    <td>  28,600   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>  East Midlands   </td>\n    <td>  28,500   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>  West Midlands   </td>\n    <td>  22,000   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>  East   </td>\n    <td>  25,300   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>  London   </td>\n    <td>  34,800   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>  South East   </td>\n    <td>  44,100   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>  South West   </td>\n    <td>  46,100   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>  Wales   </td>\n    <td>  13,210   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>  Scotland  </td>\n    <td>  13,200   </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n####Table 6: Rental price sample counts by property type\n\n<table border=1>\n  <tr>\n    <th>  Property Type   </th>\n    <th>  Sample count   </th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>  Flat   </td>\n    <td>  131,500   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>  Terraced   </td>\n    <td>  86,500   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>  Semi-detached   </td>\n    <td>  49,200   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>  Detached   </td>\n    <td>  34,500   </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n####S2.2.3 Monthly periods\n\nFor England, Wales and Scotland, a cut-off date of the 27th of the month, based on the entry date into the system, is applied to the private rental dataset to enable monthly processing. Therefore, each month the dataset covers the period from the 28th of the previous month to the 27th of the current month. \n\nDue to current data collection practices, data will be lagged by around 1 month, as it can take rent officers up to 6 weeks to input prices into the collection database. It is unlikely that this would have any implications for the rental index, as rental values do not change much from one month to the next (see Figure E4 of the article [Improvements to the measurement of owner occupiers’ housing costs and private housing rental prices][4]). Therefore any price change will be slow.\n\n####S2.2.4 Validity period\n\nTo calculate a rental price index, the sample of properties is monitored for price change throughout the year. This is done by matching the records collected each month by rent officers to the existing sample. There is no formal procedure in place that requires rent officers to follow up the sampled properties, although around 40% of sampled properties are followed up around a year later. Therefore, when a rental price is collected, it is assumed to be valid for 14 months from its entry date into the system, or until an update is received. A 14-month validity period is used as it balances typical contract lengths (which tend to be either 6, 12, 18 or 24 months) against operational practices, in particular the time it takes rent officers to follow up the same property. There is an emphasis on following up properties between 12 and 14 months since they were last collected, and therefore there are methodological benefits (in terms of significantly improving the number of property updates) to using a 14-monthly validity period over using a 6-month period (which would only capture a very small portion of updates) or a 12-month period (which would capture around half of the updates). Moreover, the 14-month validity period has the additional advantage of mitigating for properties that were originally rented some time ago at much lower prices, as well as limiting the effect of depreciation.\n\nFurther information on the rationale for using a 14-month validity period is provided in the article [Improvements to the measurement of owner-occupiers’ housing costs and private housing rental prices][5] (see Annex D).\n\n####S2.2.5 Property price updates\n\nThe price of an existing property in the sample is updated when a match is identified in the data collected each month (referred to as the input dataset), and the price change is within the acceptable tolerance level (see Box 1). On average, around 0.1% of England updates fail the tolerance test^4^. If an update is made, the record entry date is amended and the rent for that record becomes valid again for up to 14 months. \n\nProperties in the input dataset that do not match any records in the sample are added to the substitution pool to be used later in the processing. If an update fails the tolerance check then the property is deleted and not included in the sample or returned to the substitution pool.  \n\n<table border=1>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Box 1: Tolerance check<p>\nThe price update is deemed valid if it meets both of the following constraints:<p>\nNew price &lt; Previous price * 1.49995<br>\nNew price &gt; Previous price * 0.6667</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n####S2.2.6 Comparable property replacements \n\nIf a property in the sample has reached the end of its 14-month validity period, and no price update has been made, a replacement property of comparable quality is sought from the substitution pool. A replacement is defined as comparable if it has the same:\n\n- property type\n- postcode sector^5^\n- number of bedrooms\n- furnished status (furnished or unfurnished)\n\nand, has a price quote which meets the same tolerance checks applied to price updates (see Box 1 above). \n\nIf there is more than one potential replacement property, then the property collected most recently is chosen. When a comparable replacement is found, and it passes the tolerance test, then the property is used to replace the outgoing property in the sample. This replacement property maintains its original entry date into the system. By replacing the property that has expired with a comparable replacement, it is assumed that the replacement property is similar enough to the one that it is replacing that any difference in rent is due to price change, and not a difference in quality. If a replacement is found, but it fails the tolerance check, then the property is returned to the substitution pool and another replacement is sought. The comparable replacement procedure is summarised in Figure 1.\n\n<ons-image path=\"0180b356\" />\n\n####S2.2.7 Non-comparable property replacements and imputation\n\nIf a property in the sample has reached the end of its 14-month validity period, and a comparable replacement cannot be found, then the property is replaced by a non-comparable property in the substitution pool from within the same stratum. Although the replacement is non-comparable, an effort is still made to make the replacement property as comparable as possible to the property it is replacing. Therefore, the following priority order is applied to identify a non-comparable replacement:\n\n1. Match on stratum, number of bedrooms and Local Authority\n2. Match on stratum and number of bedrooms\n3. Match on stratum and postcode sector\n4. Match on stratum and Local Authority\n5. Match on stratum only\n\nAs the name suggests, the replacement property is deemed to be a different quality to the one it is replacing, and therefore the price of the new and replaced property cannot be directly compared. No explicit information is available to quantify the difference in quality; therefore an implicit approach is taken. A new January (base) price is calculated for the new property based on the movement of comparable replacements made within the same stratum in the same month; this movement is referred to as the imputation ratio. For more information about how the imputation ratio is calculated see Annex E. \n\nProperties that have been used as non-comparable replacements are removed from the substitution pool and replace the expired property in the sample. The non-comparable replacement maintains its entry date into the system. If there is no non-comparable match available then the property is removed from the sample^6^. This information is summarised in the flow chart in Figure 1.\n\n###S2.3 Methodology used to aggregate private rental price indices to form the OOH component in CPIH and IPHRP\n\nAs covered in the previous section, the data are stratified by Wales, Scotland and the nine regions of England as well as by property type and whether the property is furnished or unfurnished. For each stratum, elementary aggregates are calculated which are then weighted together to create an aggregate index. Strata weights for OOH and IPHRP are updated annually. Strata weights for OOH are designed to represent the owner occupied market and strata weights for IPHRP are designed to represent the private rental market. For example, looking at the range of housing available on the market, there would be a larger proportion of lower quality rental properties (for example, one bedroom flats), and the weights calculated would reflect this mix. By comparison, the owner-occupied housing weights will reflect the larger proportion of higher quality properties (for example, three bedroom detached houses). Expenditure weights are calculated by multiplying dwelling stock counts for the owner occupied sector or private rental sector by average rental prices. The methodology for constructing the OOH index is described in more detail in the following sections.\n\n####S2.3.1 Elementary Aggregates\n\nElementary aggregates for England are provided by VOA, while we calculate elementary aggregates for Wales and Scotland, using the microdata, which are delivered on a monthly basis. All use the same methodology.\nThe Jevons formula (the geometric mean of price relatives, using January as its base month) is used to aggregate private rent prices below the stratum level for OOH, IPHRP and the private rents component in CPIH, CPI and RPIJ. Using exactly the same underlying data, private rents for the RPI are aggregated below the stratum level using the Carli formula (the arithmetic mean of price relatives). \n\n####S2.3.2 Dwelling stock data\n\nDwelling stock data for the owner-occupied and rental sectors comes from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) for England and its regions. The data are collected via the English Housing Survey (EHS) which has a sample size of around 13,300 households. Similar dwelling stock data are also available from the Scottish Government for Scotland and the Welsh Government for Wales. \n\nFor the private rented sector, dwelling stock estimates are also split by the proportion of property types rented privately in Wales, Scotland and the nine regions of England. For the owner-occupied sector, a split by property type is only available at a national level so the same property type split is applied across all regions^7^. \n\n####S2.3.3 Average rental prices\n\nAverage rental prices, split by the nine English regions, property type and whether the property is furnished or unfurnished are provided annually by VOA. These averages are calculated using all of the rents data collected by VOA rent officers in the relevant year, and are therefore not directly comparable to the sample of rents followed for the private rents price indices.\n\nWe calculate the average rental prices for Wales and Scotland by using the microdata delivered on a monthly basis. Again, all the data collected in the relevant year are used to calculate these averages and therefore it does not compare directly to the sample of rents followed for the private rents price indices. \nThe averages for a given year cover the period from February of the previous year to January of the current year. For example, the average price used for the 2014 weights is based on data from the period February 2013 to January 2014.\n\n####S2.3.4 Strata weight construction\n\nTo calculate timely expenditure strata weights, the most recently available data are used. For a given index year y, the expenditure shares are based on the time periods set out in Table 7.\n\n####Table 7: Source data for expenditure shares in index year y\n\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>&nbsp;</th>\n    <th>Period</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Dwelling stock data</th>\n    <td style=\"text-align:center;\">y-3 years</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Average prices data</th>\n    <td style=\"text-align:center;\">y-1 years</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nTotal expenditure is calculated by multiplying dwelling stock counts by average rental prices for each combination of region or country, property type and furnished or unfurnished status. This is equivalent to using price-updated household expenditure data at a lag of 3 years. This is not out of keeping with the treatment of other below item level weights.\n\nThe relative expenditure weight for each stratum is then calculated using the aggregate level expenditure. For the equation used to calculate expenditure weights, please see Annex E.\n\nAs with the price sample, this weighting procedure gives 88 different expenditure weights for IPHRP, one for each of the nine English regions plus Wales and Scotland, four property types and furnished or unfurnished status. The OOH index has 48 different expenditure weights. As the index only uses unfurnished rents there is no furnished or unfurnished split, but it does include weights for Northern Ireland.\n\n###S2.4 Owner-occupiers’ housing cost weight in CPIH \n\nThe OOH component is aggregated with other items in the fixed basket of goods and services to form headline CPIH. As with other items, expenditure weights are used to aggregate the item indices (for more information see the [Consumer Price Indices – Technical Manual][6]). National accounts household final consumption expenditure (HHFCE) data are used to create the expenditure weights for many of the basket items, and the same is true of the OOH component, where HHFCE data on imputed rentals (the rental equivalence measure) are used.\n\nNational accounts data are generally preferred as the source of weights for the CPI and CPIH, and are consistent with other economic measures published in the Blue Book and Pink Book. The national accounts are compiled on a domestic basis (see Box 2), which is consistent with the HICP framework on which CPIH is based. By contrast, other measures, such as the Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF), measure expenditure on a national basis. National accounts data also cover a more complete range of goods and services, and follow the classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP) used in the HICP. Moreover, due to small sample sizes, the LCF data can be volatile.\n\n<table border=1>\n  <tr>\n    <td> Box 2: Domestic and national expenditure<p>\nDomestic expenditure is all expenditure that occurs within the economic territory.<p>\nThis includes spending by foreign visitors to the UK.<p>\nThis excludes spending by UK residents abroad.<p>\nNational expenditure is all expenditure by the resident population.<p>\nThis excludes spending by foreign visitors to the UK.<p>\nThis includes spending by UK residents abroad.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n####S2.4.1 Calculation of the OOH weight\n\nImputed rentals expenditure data are taken from the latest available national accounts dataset, which is published in Quarter 3 (July to Sept), and is consistent with the most recent Blue Book release (typically published in June or September). The non-seasonally adjusted current price series for 0.4.2 Imputed rents is used. Imputed rents is aggregated from 2 component series: 0.4.2.1 Imputed rents for owner occupiers and 0.4.2.2 Other imputed rents, such as secondary residences and households paying free or reduced rent. The national accounts calculate imputed rentals expenditure by multiplying dwelling stock counts – sourced from DCLG – by average rental prices – which are sourced from the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), and the Welsh and Scottish governments as appropriate (see section S2.1). For the latest period, DCLG dwelling stock counts and average rental prices are not available, so the data are forecast using our [standard forecasting principles][7]. \n\nNational accounts estimates are produced on a volume and value (or current price) basis. For the imputed rentals component a value measure is initially produced. This is then deflated using a price index to create the volume measure. In 2014 national accounts started to use CPIH, and backdated this to 2010. From Blue Book 2016, CPIH is used for the entire time series. For more information on the calculation of imputed rentals expenditure, please see the article [Changes to National Accounts: Imputed Rental][8].\n\nWeights are updated annually with the January index, and there is a further update in February to coincide with the introduction of new items to the CPIH basket. For a given year y, the expenditure shares are based on the year y-2, reflecting the most up-to-date expenditure data available. This means that, in using the most recent data, the expenditure data used in the calculation of OOH weights reflect 1 period ahead forecasts. In January, expenditure weights are price updated to December of year y-1. Between February and December, expenditure weights are price updated to January of year y. This process is shown in Figure 2. The formula for this can be found in Annex E. For more information on price updating and chain linking, please see the article [Assessing the impact of methodological improvements on the Consumer Prices Index][9], and the [Consumer Price Indices – Technical Manual][10]. \n\n<ons-image path=\"6e6cf949\" />\n \n####S2.4.2 Revisions to expenditure\n\nWhereas national accounts estimates are typically revised, large revisions to expenditure, such as [those seen in 2015][11], are rare. Consumer price indices are rarely revised; however, in 2016 and 2017 we made revisions to the OOH expenditure weights in CPIH. These revisions are described below.\n\n###2015 revisions\n\nIn 2015 we were made aware of substantial changes that were being made to the [measurement of imputed rentals][12]. This would introduce a large step change in the OOH weight. As [improvements to the OOH index][13] were being introduced in CPIH, we also took the opportunity to revise the OOH weights. This would mitigate a future step change, and put OOH weights on a consistent basis back to 2005. As this predated the publication of Blue Book 2016, national accounts estimated expenditure in an offline system. This was used to revise the OOH weight. Only the OOH series was revised.\n\n###2017 revisions\n\nThese unpublished estimates were, in fact, higher than the final Blue Book 2016 estimates. In March 2017 [additional improvements][14] were introduced into CPI and CPIH, and CPIH was revised to introduce [Council Tax][15]. This presented a further opportunity to revise the OOH weights and, in March 2017, the weights were revised to be consistent with final Blue Book 2016 expenditure back to 2005. This means that the step change in OOH weights has been avoided and they are as up to date as possible.\n\nRevisions were based on expenditure from year y-2, and price updated to the appropriate month (as described in section S2.4.1). This is consistent with our usual methodology. This means that from 2017 onwards OOH expenditure weights will be based on national accounts forecasts, as usual. However, from 2005 to 2016 OOH expenditure weights are based on the actual data.\n\n###National accounts revisions\n\nThe large revisions seen in Blue Book 2016 were revisions to the methodology. In the national accounts methodological changes are revised for the whole time series. The history of methodological revisions to imputed rentals is as follows.\n\nIn 2013, there were some changes to the [measurement of intermediate consumption][16] for imputed rentals, which were relatively large\n\nThere were also some changes made for Blue Book 2014, which introduced an [interim fix][17] to make the current price and chained volume measures consistent. This had an impact in 2014 and 2015 and was revised back to 2010, in line with the Supply-Use revisions window. These changes were relatively small in comparison to the Blue Book 2016 changes.\n\n[Large scale improvements][18] to the calculation of imputed rentals were introduced in Blue Book 2016.\n\nThere are some small refinements planned for Blue Book 2017\n\nThere are no further methodological changes planned for imputed rentals. \n\nRevisions to the national accounts based on updated data are only revised back 2 years. Data revisions are made every year. Historically data revisions have not been large; however, given that the methodology has been improved it is difficult to say what these data revisions will look like in the future. We do not expect to revise the expenditure weights in the foreseeable future. \n\nThere are other factors that can cause the data to be revised, such as the supply-use balancing process. For more information on the national accounts revisions policy see [Revisions policies for economic statistics][19].\n\n###S2.5 Summary\n\nIn summary, unfurnished rental price data from VOA, the Welsh and Scottish governments, and Northern Ireland data from the local price collection are compiled into price indices for each of 12 regions and 4 property types. These are weighted together using “strata weights” that reflect the OOH market to form an OOH index. Strata weights are constructed from DCLG dwelling stock counts (lagged by 3 years) and average rental prices (lagged by 1 year). This OOH item level index is then weighted into CPIH using OOH weights, based on national accounts HHFCE expenditure data. These data are lagged by 2 years, consistent with other item level CPIH weights. The structure for aggregating OOH data into CPIH is summarised in Figure 3.\n\n<ons-image path=\"4b9a159b\" />\n\n###S2.6 Net acquisitions methodology\n\nIn the preceding sections we have discussed the construction of the rental equivalence measure of OOH, which is used in the CPIH. As discussed in Section S1, we currently also produce an OOH measure for Eurostat following the net acquisitions approach. As this experimental index contributes to the discussions on the preferred choice of OOH measure, the methodology used to construct it will be presented in this section. We follow the methodology prescribed by [Eurostat][20]. This aggregates component sub-indices measuring different aspects of OOH costs into two classes; those related to the acquisition of dwellings, and those related to the ownership of dwellings.\n\nThe ideal method for excluding the land component in OOH(NA) is the net/net approach, whereby prices and weights both exclude the land component (and therefore the asset price) from the house purchase. However, as many member states (including the UK) are unable to implement the net/net approach due to a lack of available data, Eurostat requires all member states to use the net/gross (net weight, gross price) approach. So, for example, the HPI is used to measure price changes for the “Acquisition of New Dwellings (excluding land)” component. The HPI, however, does not separate into land and dwelling components, so the total house price is used. This is the gross price approach. On the other hand the expenditure weights for the same component are for the dwelling costs and do not include the cost of land. This is the net weight approach. This means that the net acquisitions approach presented here will include some measure of asset price in the index. The sources of price and expenditure data for all of the components are presented in Table 9. With the exception of the stamp duty index, all are drawn from our existing publications, including the Producer Price Index (PPI) and Retail Prices Index (RPI). \n\nThe source of component expenditure weights used to compile OOH(NA) are derived from the National Accounts Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) and Household Final Consumption Expenditure (HHFCE). The “net” principle in net acquisitions relates to the fact that only transactions that occur between the OOH sector and other sectors (for example, construction firms and private landlords) should be included. However, we cannot currently distinguish between sectors, and therefore the weight for “Acquisition of New Dwellings” includes expenditure on all newly constructed dwellings and not those specifically destined for the OOH sector as per the methodology outlined by Eurostat. In addition, a weight for “Existing Dwellings New to the OOH Sector” does not exist; therefore, a zero weight is currently applied. The “Other services related to ownership of dwellings” is based on the national accounts series 04.4.4 Other services relating to the dwelling and has zero expenditure recorded in Blue Book 2016. It therefore has a weight of 0 in the net acquisitions approach, and is excluded from the calculation.\n\n####Table 9: Data sources for the net acquisitions measure of OOH\n\n  \t<table border=1>\n  <tr>\n    <th>     </th>\n    <th colspan=\"4\">Acquisition of dwellings  </th>\n    <th colspan=\"3\">Ownership of dwellings</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>OOH(NA) Indices  </td>\n    <td>Acquisitions of New Dwellings (exc.

We also publish a quarterly article which compares the different measures of OOH against one another, and includes an analysis of the contribution of the different components of the net acquisitions measure. The latest release can be accessed [on our website][22].\n\n#####Notes for Section 2: Constructing the rental equivalence measure of OOH:\n\n1. Introduced in England, Wales and Scotland in April 2008, the LHA is a flat rate allowance paid to housing benefit claimants living in private sector accommodation. LHA rates depend on the rental prices in the surrounding Broad Rental Market Area (BRMA) that the rented property falls in, and discounts are applied for the number of bedrooms in the property. They are set as the lower of the 30th percentile on a list of rents in the BRMA, or the existing LHA. Prior to this, the LRR was used and still applies to those who have claimed Housing Benefit without a break from the same home since before the introduction of the LHA. The LRR is the mid-point between what, in the Rent Officers’ opinion, are the highest and lowest non-exceptional rents in a BRMA.\n2. For more information see the [Consumer Price Indices - Technical Manual][23].\n3. Stratification is the process of subdividing the population into subgroups of similar units, which are sampled independently. Each unit will belong to one and only one group. A random sample is then drawn from each stratum.\n4. Based on data from February to June 2016.\n5. UK postcodes consist of an outward and inward code. The outward code comes before the single space in the middle, and the inward code come after the space. Postcode sectors are made up of the outward code and the first character of the inward code.  For example, NP10 8 is the postcode sector for NP10 8XG. On average there are approximately 2,300 properties in a postcode sector.\n6. In practice this is very rare. For example, between January 2012 and December 2014 this only occurred in one month.\n7. A [detailed description of the surveys and methods][24] used to derive dwelling stock estimates for the privately rented sector is available.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/indexofprivatehousingrentalpricesreferencetables\n  [2]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices---technical-manual/2014/index.html\n  [3]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports-and-correspondence/reviews/uk-consumer-price-statistics-a-review/\n  [4]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/improvements-to-the-measurement-of-owner-occupiers--housing-costs-and-private-housing-rental-prices/index.html\n  [5]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/improvements-to-the-measurement-of-owner-occupiers--housing.pdf\n  [6]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices---technical-manual/2014/index.html\n  [7]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/gss-methodology-series/ons-working-paper-series/index.html\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/changestonationalaccounts/imputedrental\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/assessingtheimpactofmethodologicalimprovementsontheconsumerpricesindex\n  [10]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices---technical-manual/2014/index.html\n  [11]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/revising-the-weight-of-owner-occupiers--housing-in-cpih/index.html\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/changestonationalaccounts/imputedrental\n  [13]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/improvements-to-the-measurement-of-owner-occupiers--housing-costs-and-private-housing-rental-prices/index.html\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/assessingtheimpactofmethodologicalimprovementsontheconsumerpricesindex\n  [15]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/impactofinclusionofcounciltaxandrevisedimputedrentsoncpih/dec2016\n  [16]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171766_315500.pdf\n  [17]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/changestonationalaccounts/imputedrental\n  [18]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/changestonationalaccounts/imputedrental\n  [19]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/revisions/revisionspoliciesforeconomicstatistics\n  [20]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat\n  [21]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/ukowneroccupiedhousingcostsoohnetacquisitionsapproachjantomar2016\n  [22]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/owneroccupiedhousingcostsusingthenetacquisitionsapproach/latest\n  [23]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices---technical-manual/2014/index.html\n  [24]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/hpi/index-of-private-housing-rental-prices/historical-series/iphrp-article.html#tab-Methodology-of-IPHRP",

            {
              "markdown": "In Sections S1 and S2 we demonstrated how the rental equivalence approach is the most suitable measure of owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) costs in the UK due to the exclusion of asset prices, and how its construction is underpinned by a large, good quality source of rental data, which is representative of the rental market. For more information on the quality of data sources that feed into CPIH, please see the Quality Assurance of Administrative Data (QAAD). To ensure that the quality of the index is maintained over time, it is important to be mindful of issues that have the potential to bias or impact on the precision of the index. We therefore turn now to the sources of bias that have the potential to impact on the OOH component of CPIH. We consider this first in the context of the data sources and the method of sampling, before discussing political events that may impact on data collection or the general level of rents. Finally we reference some user concerns that have been raised regarding the OOH component of CPIH.\n\n###S3.1 Data\n\nWhile we do not have direct access to the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) microdata, robust procedures have been put in place to ensure that the potential for errors is minimised. Our staff were involved in designing the methodology and systems for VOAs production of the elementary aggregate indices.  Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are now in place between ourselves and VOA, and we are notified of any changes to systems. Changes are quality assured by our staff. VOA also provides us with quality assurance documentation. We do not have direct access to the microdata for Wales and Scotland, so this can be used to test new methodologies.\n\nThe data collected may not be perfectly suited to the measurement of OOH on a rental equivalence basis, as the primary purpose of the data is for the setting of Local Authority rents. However, this is true of all administrative data sources. The sample itself is large and representative of the target market, and stratum weights are used to mix adjust the sample to reflect the OOH population (Section S2.3).\n\nThe sample for the Northern Ireland stratum is very small. This is because it is still based on the local collection method used elsewhere in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). With the improvements in the Northern Ireland Housing Executive’s private rental data, which are now available monthly (formerly bi-annually); We hope to introduce improvements in line with the methodology for England, Scotland and Wales. Data for Scotland are based on advertised rents rather than achieved rents. While this is a potential source of bias, the property services group Countrywide [published evidence][1] to suggest that achieved rents in Scotland are 99.7% of advertised rents, suggesting that it makes little difference.\n\n###S3.2 Sampling and representativity\n\nOne potential source of bias arises from the fact that rental data are collected using purposive sampling rather than a probability sample. Rent collectors aim to capture at least 10% of private rentals using census counts as a target. As with the local price collection, where price collectors use their market knowledge and retailer knowledge to select an item which is representative of consumer expenditure, rent collectors use their knowledge of the rental market to select rents that are as representative of the market as possible. Of course, the rental market may not necessarily be representative of the owner-occupiers’ housing market. We would expect, for example, that in the rental market there are a greater number of flats and smaller houses, whereas the owner-occupiers’ market may be dominated by standard and larger-sized houses. This potential source of bias is mitigated by mix adjustment (see Section S2.3). In other words, the stratum weights are used to weight the rental data so that they reflect the owner occupier population. Due to the large sample size, we retain a reasonable sample in even the smallest strata (719 for detached houses in London). Moreover, certain property types are excluded from the VOA sample, such as halls of residence, and housing benefits claimants.\n\nThe original sampling methodology meant that, in some strata, it was difficult to follow products over time, resulting in non-comparable substitutions. The substitution pool method (described in Section S2.2) with the listed priorities for matching has improved this situation.\n\n###S3.3 Methodology\n\nOn 14 August 2014, the National Statistics status of CPIH was suspended due to required improvements to the comparable replacement of properties. These improvements were identified following concerns from users over the disparity between our average private rental prices, and those derived from other sources. We have worked with our suppliers to improve processing and methodology. In particular improvements have been made to the method for identifying and matching comparable replacements and reassessing the validity period. These are described in Sections S2.2.6, S2.2.7 and S2.2.4 in more detail. We are also [monitoring its sources of rental data][2] against other potential sources. We submitted its evidence for assessment of CPIH as a National Statistic to the UK Statistics Authority on 26 September 2016. The evidence contains a suite of new and updated publications, which will be used over a period of time to monitor the behaviour of the index, and increase awareness and confidence in CPIH. We hope for CPIH to be awarded National Statistic status in the first half of 2017 \n\n###S3.4 Proxy measurement\n\nThere may be some bias arising from the use of rental equivalence as a proxy to measure owner occupiers’ housing costs, as it does not measure the ongoing consumption of OOH directly. Rental equivalence is imputed from actual rentals which include some premium set by landlords to cover the costs of maintenance. To avoid double-counting, goods and services that landlords would pay for are not included separately. For example, landlords pay for buildings insurance and major repairs, so these should not be separately priced elsewhere in the index when rental equivalence is used for OOH costs. Using rents as a proxy does not counter the general economic principles of using the rental equivalence method to measure OOH.\n\n###S3.5 Continuation of data sources for CPIH\n\nThe continuation of data sources is crucial in the compilation of a long-term credible price index. The rental equivalence method in CPIH depends on the collection of private rents data by the VOA in England, and by the Scottish and Welsh Governments in Scotland and Wales respectively. There are three main issues that could impact on the collection of rental data in the future: rent controls, a falling sample of rental properties, and a change in housing benefit policy.\n\n####S3.5.1 Rent controls\n\nRent controls are government-mandated controls which place a maximum price on what landlords may charge tenants. To have an impact, they need to be set at a level below the market rate. Given the general economic principles that underlie the rental equivalence approach, the rental equivalence approach to measuring OOH could introduce a downward bias on the index if rent controls are introduced. It is believed that this is unlikely to happen, however.\n\n####S3.5.2 Sample size\n\nThe current government priority to increase the levels of home ownership through various policy measures may result in a small decrease in the sample of rental properties. This could impact on the collection of data because of the need to sample enough properties for a representative mix of housing. However, this is countered by the fall in home ownership that has occurred since the economic downturn in 2008, and the corresponding increase in private renting.\n\n####S3.5.3 Policy changes\n\nFinally, government policy on housing benefit may change in a way that would mean rental prices would no longer be needed to calculate the levels of benefit awarded, removing the need for data collection by the VOA and devolved administrations. We would be notified in advance of any change in data collection through the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with VOA.\n\n###S3.6 User concerns\n\nAs discussed in Section S1, there are several methods that may be used to measure OOH, each of which has strengths and weaknesses. Our decision to use the rental equivalence approach is based on pragmatic choices, taking all of the [quality dimensions][3] into account. In making our decision we received [expert advice from CPAC][4], and [the Johnson Review][5] (2015) has subsequently recommended that “ONS should continue to produce CPIH using rental equivalence as the method for calculating owner occupiers housing costs’ and ‘work towards making CPIH its main measure of inflation”. We are confident in our decision to use the rental equivalence measure of OOH costs; however, a decision of this type is unlikely to find universal approval. We recognise that some users have expressed concerns. These concerns are summarised below, and references are provided to where these issues are discussed in more detail.\n\nThis section provides an index list of concerns for users to reference. The index refers to the relevant page in this compendium where these issues are discussed further.\n\n####S3.6.1 Conceptual\n\ni. The use of a proxy to estimate OOH is inappropriate\nAll of the methods have drawbacks and benefits. The rental equivalence measure is the only method that effectively captures the cost of consumption by excluding asset prices. Additionally, it is based on a good quality data source, and is commonly used in other national statistical institutes (NSIs). For more information see Section S1.2.5 on accuracy and Section S3.4 on proxy measurement.\n\nii. A stock measure inappropriately reflects depreciation\nProperties remain in the sample for a maximum of 14 months. This will limit the effect of depreciation. For more information see Section S2.2.4 on the validity period.  Additionally, [the Johnson Review][6] (2015) recommended exploring a flow measure of rental equivalence, and this will be reflected in our [Work Programme for Consumer Price Statistics][7].\n\niii. Costs to owner occupiers are different to costs faced by tenants; landlords are influenced by the rental market when setting rents\n\nUnder the economic concept of “opportunity cost”, rental equivalence captures the money forgone if the owner occupier chooses to live in their house, rather than not living in it and renting it out. Furthermore, a spotlight analysis of the relationship between rental prices and house prices, presented in the article [Understanding the different approaches of measuring owner occupier’s housing costs][8], suggests that it is reasonable to expect there to be a relationship between rents and house prices in the long term. For more information see Section S1.1.3 on rental equivalence.\n\niv. Fees paid to letting agents, un/partially refunded deposits and compulsory maintenance fees are omitted\nWith the exception of deposits these items are not rental costs and their price movements will be based on the representative item in the basket used to reflect their expenditure class. These costs are likely to be a small part of the total costs. \n\n####S3.6.2 Credibility\n\ni. Rental equivalence is unnecessarily complex, and is not credible to the public\nWhilst some people may find the rental equivalence method a harder concept to grasp, none of the measures are straightforward, and it is the only measure that accurately reflects the cost of consumption to owner occupiers. It is based on a good quality source of data, is relatively widely used internationally and is consistent with National Accounts methodology. For more information see Section S1.2.1 on accessibility and clarity.\n\nii. The difference with average rents is implausible\n\nFollowing concerns over the difference between our average rents and other sources we have made improvements to the methodology for selecting comparable replacement properties. Research has suggested that our data sources are comparable with other rental market data. For more information see Section S3.3 on methodology, Annex A.3 on IPHRP revisions, and the article [Improvements to the measurement of owner occupiers’ housing costs and private housing rental price indices][9]. We also publish a comparison of different sources of rental data alongside the [IPHRP monthly release][10].\n\niii. The quality of the measure needs to be demonstrated over a period of time\n\nWe publish a [quarterly OOH analysis][11] article, in which the rental equivalence measure is compared to other measures of OOH. Different sources of rental data are also monitored on a monthly basis, and are published alongside the Index of private housing rental prices ([IPHRP][12]).\n\n####S3.6.3 House Prices\n\ni. The measure does not follow house price booms and busts\n\nii. House prices should be included to allow monetary policy to address house price bubbles\n\nRental equivalence measures the flow of services consumed by owner occupiers. The measure is not designed to capture the change in asset prices, and so there is no a priori reason why the measure should follow house price booms and busts. We also publish a house price index which captures booms and busts in the housing market, and is used as a key economic indicator by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) alongside the CPI. For more information see Section 1.2.4 on relevance.\n\niii. A payments approach would better reflect actual inflationary pressures to the consumer\nThe payments approach is inappropriate because of the inclusion of interest, which is not appropriate for a measure of consumption. For more information see Section S1.2 on the rationale for the rental equivalence method.\n\n####S3.6.4 International\n\ni. Eurostat supports a net acquisitions approach\n\nii. Rental equivalence is inconsistent with HICP principles\n\nEurostat is considering the net acquisitions method for inclusion in the HICP. The rental equivalence method was ruled out because it is inconsistent with HICP principles on imputation, and because many countries do not have the necessary rental market to estimate the rental equivalence measure. Nevertheless, rental equivalence is widely used internationally. CPIH is intended to be a measure for the UK, that can be developed to suit the particular needs of the UK. Therefore it is necessary for CPIH not to be restricted by European methodology. For more information see Section S1.2.3 on comparability.\n\niii. CPI is based on the acquisition approach, not use\n\nWhilst the CPI is intended to be on an acquisitions basis, this is not always the case. The ICLS resolution (2003) acknowledged that it may be necessary to adopt a mixed approach, particularly with respect to OOH. For more information see Section S1.2.4 on relevance.\n\n####S3.6.5 Statistical\n\ni. We do not have access to VOA microdata\n\nOur staff have worked closely with VOA staff to ensure that methodology, systems and procedures are in line with our standards. For more information see Section S3.1 on data, Annex A.3 on revisions to private rental indices, and the QAAD.\n\nii. The VOA sample is not random; the data are unrepresentative\n\nRent officers are instructed to collect rents that are representative of the rental market to ensure that the sample is as representative as possible. For more information see Section S2.1.1 on England data and Section S3.2 on sampling and representativity.\n  \niii. Stratification of DCLG data is limited\n\nWe consider that the stratification of expenditure weights for mix adjustment is of a suitable quality. Nonetheless we intend to explore ways to create a regional split using alternative sources of data. This is reflected in the [Work Programme for Consumer Price Statistics][13]. For more information see section S3.2 on sampling and representativity (page 36).\n\niv. Northern Ireland prices are collected by survey\n\nThe stratum weight applied to the Northern Ireland index is very small. Therefore it has a limited impact on the overall OOH index. NIHE are currently undertaking a programme of development to improve the timeliness and extend coverage of rental data. We will be exploring the potential of this data to improve the private rental component for Northern Ireland, and this will be reflected in the [Work Programme for Consumer Price Statistics][14]. For more information see Section S2.1.4 on Northern Ireland data.\n\nv. Quality changes in the rental sector are not accounted for\n\nWithin the year, if a property drops out of the sample, we can make a comparable or non-comparable replacement. Comparable replacements are deemed to be of similar quality and, for non-comparable replacements, a new base price is imputed. The sample is updated each January to reflect quality changes in the current rental stock. In line with [the Johnson Review][15] (2015), we are currently reviewing the monitoring procedures for non-comparable replacements and this is reflected in the [Work Programme for Consumer Price Statistics][16]. For more information see Sections S2.2.6 and S2.2.7 on comparable and non-comparable replacements, and Section S2.2.1 on sample selection.\n\n####S3.6.6 Weights\n\ni. National Accounts OOH weights are not stable\n\nWhereas national accounts data can be revised, the [large revisions seen in 2015][17] are rare. By contrast, the Living Costs and Food Survey has a relatively small sample size, which means that the data can be volatile.\n\nii. More explanation of the derivation of weights for housing is required\n\nMore detail on the weights for the OOH component are provided in Sections S2.3 and S2.4 on Stratum weights and OOH weights respectively.\n\n####S3.6.7 Other\n\ni. Consistency with national accounts is not relevant to a measure of price change\n\nCoherence with other statistics is a desirable (but not essential) condition. Coherence is one of the [quality dimensions][18] which the Government Statistical Service (GSS) adheres to. In addition to being consistent with National Accounts methodology, and more importantly, the rental equivalence measure is the only measure that effectively measures the cost of consumption, and is based on good quality data sources. It is also widely used in other NSIs, where a measure of OOH costs is included in the headline measure of inflation. For more information see Section S1.2.7 on coherence and the summary in Section S1.2.8. \n\nWe acknowledge user’s concerns, and we recognise that these concerns may evolve or change over time. As such, we continue to welcome challenge and will hold structured dialogues with our users to address these concerns. We will continue to present analysis to aid [understanding of the different approaches of measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs][19] on a quarterly basis. This article includes a spotlight section, which will focus on more specific pieces of analysis on the OOH measure. We will consider using this section to provide additional analysis based on user concerns. This section of the CPIH compendium is also intended to evolve with these concerns.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.countrywide.co.uk/news/countrywide-plc-monthly-lettings-index-february-2016/\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/indexofprivatehousingrentalpricesreferencetables\n  [3]: https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/statistics/quality/\n  [4]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/who-ons-are/programmes-and-projects/other-development-work/consumer-prices-advisory-committee--cpac-/index.html\n  [5]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports-and-correspondence/reviews/uk-consumer-price-statistics-a-review/\n  [6]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports-and-correspondence/reviews/uk-consumer-price-statistics-a-review/\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/consumerpricesdevelopmentplan/2016-10-11\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcosts/quarter2aprtojune2016\n  [9]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/improvements-to-the-measurement-of-owner-occupiers--housing-costs-and-private-housing-rental-prices/index.html\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/indexofprivatehousingrentalpricesreferencetables\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/owneroccupiedhousingcostsusingthenetacquisitionsapproach/latest\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/indexofprivatehousingrentalpricesreferencetables\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/consumerpricesdevelopmentplan/2016-10-11\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/consumerpricesdevelopmentplan/2016-10-11\n  [15]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports-and-correspondence/reviews/uk-consumer-price-statistics-a-review/\n  [16]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/consumerpricesdevelopmentplan/2016-10-11\n  [17]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/revising-the-weight-of-owner-occupiers--housing-in-cpih/index.html\n  [18]: https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/statistics/quality/\n  [19]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcosts/quarter2aprtojune2016",

              "markdown": "As the intended headline measure of consumer price inflation, CPIH is an important and potentially influential statistic. We are committed to maintaining the quality of the index. This includes continuing an ongoing programme of development for the index, as well as monitoring the behaviour of the index over time. \n\nWe will continue to present analysis to aid the [understanding of different approaches of measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) costs in the UK][1], which we will update on a quarterly basis. This will be published alongside the net acquisitions measure of OOH which is produced for Eurostat. Additionally we will continue to compare its sources of rental data against other sources. This analysis will be published alongside the Index of private housing rental prices ([IPHRP][2]). These outputs will allow us to monitor the OOH measure over time. \n\nWe will also continue to explore ways to improve the OOH measure. We will explore improving the OOH index for Northern Ireland through alternative sources of rental data, such as the emerging data source from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE). We will also be exploring data sources that will allow us to identify a regional breakdown of the stratum weights. In line with [the Johnson Review][3] (2015), we will also consider whether a flow measure of rents would be more appropriate. These developments are all reflected in our [Work Programme for Consumer Price Statistics][4].\n\nFurther improvements to CPIH will be introduced in March 2017, when Council Tax will be introduced into the index. In 2012 [CPAC recommended][5] that Council Tax should be in CPIH, and this advice was supported by [the Johnson Review][6] (2015), which recommended that ‘the UK Statistics Authority should consult on including council tax in CPIH’. Following the consultation, in his [letter][7] of the 9 March 2016, the National Statistician stated that we will be preparing to include Council Tax in the CPIH calculation. Council tax will be included in the February 2017 index, published in March. Although consumer price indices are rarely revised, we will take this opportunity to revise the OOH component of CPIH to bring expenditure weights into line with the latest National Accounts estimates, and also include Council Tax in the index back to 2005. \n\nWe will review the Quality Assurance of Administrative Data (QAAD) on an annual basis, and other important documentation, such as the [Users and Uses][8] paper, the [Work Programme for Consumer Price Statistics][9] and this compendium will be updated as required.\n\nThis work is important to ensure the future success of CPIH, and to help establish it as the leading measure of consumer price inflation in the UK. It is intended that CPIH should become the headline measure once it has been awarded National Statistic status. It is hoped that this should be in the first half of 2017, following a period of monitoring and engagement.

They are used in many ways by individuals, government, businesses, and academics. Inflation statistics impact on everyone in some way as they affect interest rates, tax allowances, benefits, pensions, savings rates, maintenance contracts and many other payments. The uses to which consumer price inflation statistics are put (notably indexation) means that it is imperative that every effort is made to ensure all data are included in the first release of any month’s figures and that revisions are avoided. \n\nRe-referencing, which refers to a rescaling of the indices so that they equal 100 for a given year, is not considered to be a revision in this context as it does not impact on the published inflation rates. The most recent instance of this was when CPI and CPIH were re-referenced to 2015=100, implemented in the January 2016 results.\n",

OOH are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. This is distinct from the cost of purchasing a house, which is partly an accumulation of wealth and partly for housing services.\n\nThere is not a single defined measure of OOH because it can be calculated differently depending on what the target is. In particular, should OOH be measured at the point of acquisition of the housing service (for example, the net acquisitions approach), the point of use (for example, the rental equivalence approach), or the point at which it is paid for (for example, the payments approach)? Each of these 3 approaches has its own specific methodological strengths and weaknesses, and is measured using different methods.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/news/statementsandletters/statementonfutureofconsumerpriceinflationstatisticsintheuk",

              "markdown": "Although each of the methods discussed in Section 4 measure different aspects of OOH and are therefore not comparable, it is still useful to look at the 3 measures together to see how they differ over time. Figure 1 presents the rental equivalence approach – OOH(RE), the net acquisitions approach – OOH(NA), and the payments approach – OOH(Payments), indexed to 2005 = 100. This analysis is also presented in the [most recent quarterly article][1]. It suggests that since 2005, OOH(NA) has shown the strongest growth over the period. OOH(Payments) saw strong growth prior to the economic downturn due to price increases in mortgage interest payments. Of the 3 measures, it has also seen the largest fall since the economic downturn, again driven by the falling price of mortgage interest payments, and has still not recovered its pre-downturn peak.\n\n<ons-image path=\"dad9f7dd\" />\n\nOOH(RE) appears at a lag to the OOH(NA) and OOH(Payments) approaches for the peak and trough before and after the economic downturn. This can be seen more clearly in Figure 2, which presents the quarter on corresponding quarter in previous year growth rates for the 3 approaches. This lag is because OOH(RE) is a “stock” measure of rents. This means that it captures price information for the entire stock of rental properties, which includes existing contracted properties and properties that are new to the market. Therefore, the flow of new rents based on recent developments in house prices will only gradually influence its development because the stock of existing dwellings is so much larger. This also means that the relative peaks and troughs of OOH(RE) will be subdued relative to OOH(NA) because the large stock of contracted rental properties is likely to mute the impact of volatile house prices.\n\nThe fact that OOH(RE) does not directly follow house prices is not a disadvantage to using the rental equivalence approach in the calculation of the owner occupier’s housing costs component in CPIH. This is because the rental equivalence approach aims to measure the housing services that are consumed each period, and therefore there is no reason why it should follow the trend of house prices. If consideration is required of house prices, the House Price Index (HPI) should be used instead.\n\n<ons-image path=\"7a84d8c7\" />\n\nThe annual growth rates for each approach are given in Table 1. The table also presents the average growth from 2006 to 2015, and 2012 to 2015. While OOH(NA) has the highest average growth rate of the 3 approaches over the period, there is only a 0.1 percentage point difference between the average growth rate of OOH(NA) and OOH(RE) since 2012.  \n\n<ons-table path=\"cc1aebe4\" />\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcosts/quarter3julytosept2016",

              "markdown": "This section will first look at the weights that each of the approaches discussed above would have if they were to be used to measure owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) alongside the existing Consumer Prices Index (CPI). This analysis includes the weights of the sub-component indices for each OOH approach as well as the approaches’ total relative weight alongside the basket of goods and services included within CPI. For each approach, a contributions chart is presented which shows the experimental aggregate price index and the relative size of contributions from the OOH component.\n\nA comparison of the different aggregate price indices using each of the approaches – CPI-H(NA) and 2 methods to calculate CPI-H(Payments) – are provided at the end of the section and compared with CPIH, which is the existing CPI basket plus the rental equivalence approach of measuring OOH.\n\nFor more information on the methodology and underlying concepts for each of the different approaches, please see the latest [Understanding the different approaches of measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH)][1]. Users should note that the payments approach and net acquisitions are both experimental indices and therefore we would caution against any use other than for research purposes. We are continuing to work on identifying possible improvements to the current methodology and data sources. Any changes to the indices will be highlighted in the future quarterly releases.\n\n###Payments approach\n\nThere are 2 different methods that we have used to calculate weights for the payments approach. This is because of the disparity between the Retail Prices Index (RPI) and CPI total expenditure figures that arises because of a difference in data source. The RPI uses the Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) as its main data source for its expenditure weights, while the CPIH and CPI use Household Final Consumption Expenditure (HHFCE) provided by national accounts. The HHFCE gives a much higher level of expenditure because of its coverage and scope. For example, the LCF does not include expenditure from some types of communal households like student halls and residential care homes that are included in the HHFCE.\n\nThe first method – CPI-H(Payments1) – calculates the majority of the sub-components using LCF data (as in the RPI). This method has a lower total relative weight in the aggregate measure because of the disparity between the RPI and CPI total expenditure figures. This is the method we have used in [previous articles][2] to calculate OOH(Payments).\n\n The second method – CPI-H(Payments2) – attempts to correct for this disparity by reapportioning the RPI weights according to the CPI total expenditure. The method takes the expenditure ratio between the RPI and CPI total expenditure and multiplies the individual sub-component expenditure by this ratio. This up-scaled expenditure is then used to calculate the new expenditure weights for OOH(Payments2). This reduces the contribution of stamp duty and major repairs and maintenance and increases the weight of the RPI components such as mortgage interest payments. The method has a higher total relative weight in the aggregate measure. \n\nTables 2a and 2b present the weights for 2 methodologies.\n\n<ons-table path=\"cda12297\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"fee1823c\" />\n\nFigure 3 presents a comparison of the 2 OOH(Payments) indices calculated using the original methodology – OOH(Payments1) – and the reapportioned methodology – OOH(Payments2). The use of the CPI total expenditure to reapportion the RPI expenditure weights means that indices on an RPI basis have an increased weight in the new methodology. This means that movements in mortgage interest payments, which are on an RPI basis in the original methodology, have an increased impact. This explains why OOH(Payments2) grows at a faster rate before the economic downturn than the current methodology, and consequentially falls faster following the decrease in the Bank of England base rate in 2009.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"1bafa39a\" />\n\nThe growth rates for the experimental aggregate price indices using the 2 payments methods are presented in Figures 4a and 4b. The stacked bars represent the contributions to the growth rate from the OOH component compared with the other goods and services in the CPI basket. \n\nFor both methods, the stabilisation in interest rates since 2009 has meant that the OOH(Payments) component has contributed only slightly to the growth in the aggregate price index since the end of 2010, corresponding to its flat growth profile seen in Figure 2. The largest negative contributions came from the fall in the price of mortgage interest payments in 2009. For CPI-H(Payments2), this resulted in negative growth in the aggregate price index because mortgage interest payments have a higher weight in this method.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"812b6742\" />\n\n<ons-chart path=\"9f1bf2f5\" />\n\n###Net acquisitions\n\nTable 3 presents the weights used for the sub components of the net acquisitions approach and its relative weight in an aggregate measure of CPI-H(NA). While the measure presented here is the best measure of the net acquisitions approach that we can currently produce, the lack of available source data means that some components are not recorded fully. For instance, the methodology used does not separate between the land and house price, and therefore there will be some measure of asset price included in the approach, which in principle we would want to exclude from both the weights and price indices. There is also no available weighting information for “Existing Dwellings New to the OOH Sector”; therefore, a zero weight is currently applied. We therefore advise that OOH(NA) should be used and referred to with caution, and it is consequently not our favoured approach of measuring OOH. For more information about the methodology used to calculate the weights for OOH(NA), please see [the quarterly article][3].\n\n<ons-table path=\"b45ca978\" />\n\nThe contributions to the experimental aggregate price index growth rate using the net acquisitions approach are presented in Figure 5. Negative contributions from the OOH(NA) component occur in the period Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2008 to Quarter 4 2009. Contributions from OOH(NA) also fall towards the end of 2012. The [main driver of these changes][4] is the sub-component “New dwellings”, which uses the House Price Index as its source data. These 2 periods of low or negative OOH(NA) contributions coincide with periods of negative or stagnating house price growth. One of the limitations of the net acquisitions approach is that movements in the asset price are not excluded from the index and can therefore influence some of the main trends shown in the data.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"55419cfb\" />\n\n###Rental equivalence\n\nThe weights for the OOH(RE) approach used in CPIH are presented in Table 4, alongside the weights for OOH in CPI-H(NA) and the 2 aggregate payment measures. The weights for all approaches show a decline in the OOH expenditure share over time, which is in line with the fall in home ownership and the marked increase in private renting that has been seen since the start of the economic downturn ([Economic Review, April 2016][5]).\n\nThe weight for OOH in CPI-H(NA), CPI-H(Payments1) and CPI-H(Payments2) is lower than the weight of OOH in CPIH. For the payments approach, this is due in part to its methodology. Although we have tried to correct for the disparity in CPI and RPI expenditure totals, which has increased the overall weight in CPI-H(Payments2), there are further improvements that could be made. For example, we are currently investigating whether there are other data sources that collect expenditure data on the sub-components which are more in line with the HHFCE scope and coverage compared with the LCF. For OOH(NA), the lack of available source data discussed above means that some components are not recorded fully. In particular, there is no available weighting information for “Existing Dwellings New to the OOH Sector”. However, even if there were some data available there is some discussion over whether this weight would indeed be negative: the existing owner-occupied dwelling stock has been falling since 2008 ([Dwelling stock, DCLG][6]). In general, as OOH(NA) is based on a “net” approach, we may expect that the expenditure weight would be lower than the weight for OOH(RE), which is calculated from expenditure on the ongoing consumption of housing services.\n\n<ons-table path=\"1edfe349\" />\n\nFigure 6 shows the contributions to the 12-month growth rate of CPIH from OOH(RE) and the other goods and services in the CPI basket. In the immediate aftermath of the economic downturn, contributions from OOH(RE) turned negative but for the rest of the time period contributions from OOH(RE) are fairly consistent at around 0.3 to 0.5 percentage points. Growth in the OOH(RE) component in 2015 offset the deflationary pressure from other goods and services in the CPI basket to a greater extent than the other 3 measures.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"98e307ff\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcosts/quarter3julytosept2016\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcosts/quarter3julytosept2016\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcosts/quarter3julytosept2016\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcosts/quarter3julytosept2016\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/economicreview/april2016#housing-tenure\n  [6]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-dwelling-stock-including-vacants",

              "markdown": "Figure 7 presents the growth rate for these aggregate price indices, CPI-H(Payments1), CPI-H(Payments2), CPI-H(NA) and CPIH, over the period Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2005 to Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2016.\n\nThe 4 approaches exhibit similar medium-run growth trends. However, the magnitudes of growth for several timeframes are substantially different. As noted previously, CPI-H(NA) appears to be heavily influenced by movements in house prices, in particular falling faster compared with CPIH in the immediate aftermath of the economic downturn and growing faster afterwards during the recovery of the housing market. The 2 payments methods exhibit similar movements but on a more substantial scale, demonstrating the impact of mortgage interest payments on the indices. In particular, the reduction of the Bank of England base rate in 2009 caused the aggregate reapportioned payments method, CPI-H(Payments2), which has a higher weight on mortgage interest payments, to turn negative in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) and Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2009.\n\nIn recent periods, CPIH has had the highest growth rate. This may be due to the slowdown in growth of house prices since the beginning of 2015 affecting CPI-H(NA), as well as the stabilisation of monetary policy over the period since 2009. The recent cut in the Bank of England base rate in August 2016 may reduce the payments aggregate price index measure further in future. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"11521075\" />\n\nThe cumulative effect of all 4 approaches is presented in Figure 8. It suggests that since 2005, CPI-H(NA) has seen the highest growth of 28.7 percentage points over the period. The range between measures is small, however. CPI-H(Payments2), which has seen the lowest growth over the period, grew by 26.8 percentage points. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"d969cb62\" />\n\nOnce we remove the impact of the economic downturn and its immediate aftermath, the range in differences between approaches over time becomes even smaller. Figure 9 presents the 4 aggregate price indices indexed to 2012. CPIH has seen the highest growth rate over the period, of 5.4 percentage points. However, the difference between CPIH and CPI-H(NA) is only 0.2 percentage points. The lowest measure – CPI-H(Payments2) – grew by 4.7 percentage points. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"2613374f\" />\n\nThe annual average growth rates for each approach are given in Table 5. Since 2006, the average growth for all 4 approaches varies by 0.2 percentage points. If we look at the period since 2012, CPIH and CPI-H(NA) have the same average growth rate of 1.4%, compared with 1.3% for the 2 payments methods. The choice of method used within an aggregate price index therefore does not have much of an effect on the headline figure over time, although it can make a difference within individual years under certain economic conditions. \n\n<ons-table path=\"1f5e6d22\" />\n",
