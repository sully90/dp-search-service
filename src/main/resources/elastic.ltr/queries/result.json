The consultation followed a review led by Mr Paul Johnson (commonly referred to as the Johnson Review) which took a comprehensive look at how inflation is measured in the UK and made a series of recommendations about the future development of these statistics^3^. The programme and priorities also reflect the priority placed on the use of alternative data sources by Professor Sir Charles Bean’s review of economic statistics (commonly referred to as the Bean Review)^4^. \n\nWe expect that our top priorities for the next few years will be to:\n\n- gain accreditation of CPIH as a [National Statistic][1] and refocus commentary on this measure\n- continue to develop the use of alternative data sources such as web scraping and point of sale scanner data\n- publish annual measures of income and price change as experienced by different household types\n- research the concepts and issues raised by the Household Inflation Index (HII) report^5^ and implement these into inflation measures where this is deemed appropriate\n- consider ways to address the formula differences between RPI and CPI\n\nFor us to be at the cutting edge of international research for consumer price indices, the programme will need to continuously evolve in light of new priorities. Therefore we will review and update this work programme periodically and an update will be provided each September to the Authority Board via the National Statistician. \n\nIn updating the work programme, we will seek the guidance of the [Advisory Panels on Consumer Prices][2] and engage with experts and users of these statistics.\n\n###3.2 High priority\n\nHigh priority items are the cornerstone of the development programme and if necessary will be prioritised over the delivery of medium and low priority items. High priority items are listed in order of implementation (of the first deliverable).\n\n####3.2.1 Use of alternative data sources\n\n#####Overview\n\nImprovements in technologies have resulted in new, alternative, sources of price data which could be used in the compilation of price indices. There are 2 main alternative data sources which could be used, specifically:\n\n- point of scale scanner data - often referred to as scanner data, collected by retailers as goods are scanned across the till; these data are often considered the gold standard for consumer prices statistics as the data include both price and volume information\n\n- web scraped data - collected using automated robots which scan retailers’ websites and extract price information\n\nThe Johnson Review and Bean Review recommended that ONS should give priority to obtaining these data, developing methods and capabilities to use them. The National statistics Quality Review (NSQR)^6^ of the Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) made several recommendations on accessing scanner and web scraped datasets, and this work will need to be carefully co-ordinated. ONS currently has several streams of research looking at these alternative sources of data. These are:\n\nSince May 2014, we have scraped daily prices from 3 large supermarket websites, collecting around 150,000 prices monthly for 35 grocery items. Preliminarily indices using this data were published in September 2015^7^ and the indices were updated again in May 2016. Following this publication, we will work towards a more regular release of these indices.\n\nIn 2015, web-based platforms for extracting data from websites began to become widely available. They use a point and click interface which enables analysts to create web scrapers without the need for specialist programming expertise. This form of web scraping is now used to support the production of hedonic models which are used to quality adjust 4 high-tech goods in the basket. The hedonic models require detailed attribute data which have historically been collected manually from websites. Where possible web scraped data extracted using this technology have been used to replace this data collection. \n\nThis technology has also been used to pilot web scraping for 10 centrally collected items in the CPI basket. The scrapers have been designed to replicate the manual online collection so existing index number methodology can be applied. The pilot started in January 2016 and the scrapers are run once a month. Depending on the success of the pilot, import.io could be used as a monthly price collection tool from early 2017.\n\nRecently we have obtained web scraped data for clothing websites from a company called WGSN. The suitability of this data for creating price indices will be assessed and a report published in mid-2017.\n\nWe are investigating the potential use of a database of rail fares transactions owned by the Association of Train Operating Companies, to improve the rail fares item in CPI. Whilst not strictly speaking scanner data, this database does have many similar characteristics to retailer transaction data, that is it holds a near census of transactions.\n\nFinally, whilst previous efforts to obtain scanner data have proved unsuccessful, there are renewed efforts within ONS, led by senior managers, to obtain such data from retailers. The timeframe to implementation is dependent on the acquisition of data and in the interim the use of web scraped data is the priority. However, if scanner data are received, the balance of priorities between web scraping and scanner data will be reviewed.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nRegular publication of indices produced using prices scraped from supermarket websites; Late 2016\n\nImport.io potentially used as a monthly price collection tool; Early 2017\n\nReport on using WGSN data (web scraped from clothing retailers) to create price indices; Mid 2017\n\nRecommendations to Eurostat on use of web scraped data in UK consumer price indices; July 2017\n\nImplementation of improvements to rail fares; Early 2019\n\n####3.2.2 Developing an Index of Household Payments\n\n####Overview\n\nThe concept of an Index of Household Payments (IHP) was first proposed by Leyland and Astin (as the Household Inflation Index, HII), culminating in a paper^8^ submitted as a response to the 2015 consultation on consumer price statistics. Suggested differences from existing measures of price change include the potential inclusion of asset prices and interest payments, plus giving each household’s expenditure equal weight. Following the consultation the National Statistician decided that the IHP could serve as an important complement to the suite of consumer price indices. \n\nWe have conducted research into the concepts and issues raised by Astin and Leyland’s paper and, in August 2016, released a discussion paper^9^. We are currently considering responses to this paper, alongside the advice of our advisory panels, which will feed into the future development of the index.\n\n####Implementation\n\nConsider responses to the discussion paper; End 2016\n\nPublication outlining final decisions on the production of IHP; Mid 2017\n\nInitiate new collections; Mid 2017\n\nRelease experimental IHP index as part of a wider analysis of income, expenditure and price change; End 2017\n\n####3.2.3 Measures of income and price change as experienced by different household types\n\n#####Overview\n\nResearch published in 2014^10^ shows that different household groups can experience different rates of inflation. Following the 2015 consultation on consumer price statistics, the National Statistician reached the decision that ONS should produce comparable measures of income and price change for different household groups on an annual basis in one publication. The initial publication will take place in 2017. We will ensure that we engage fully with users to gain feedback that will shape the further development of the measures in line with user needs.\n\nThe research on the inflation rates experienced by different household groups is based on the same price data sourced from the CPI (and CPIH). The indices could be developed further by differentiating between different products purchased, producing specific prices indices for each household group. Household sub-groups will also be produced for the IHP work, and so this item will be co-ordinated with the previous one.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nAnnual publication of measures of income and price change as experienced by different household types, followed by gathering of user feedback; 2017\n\n####3.2.4 CPIH regaining its National Statistics status\n\n#####Overview\n\nCPIH is a measure of consumer price inflation including owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). CPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental data collected by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) for England, as well as comparable data collected by the Welsh government and Scottish government, are used in the calculation of OOH. In August 2014, the National Statistics status of CPIH was suspended due to shortcomings identified in the methodology used to produce the rental indices for OOH. Improvements were implemented in 2015 and the reassessment of CPIH as a National Statistic commenced in September 2015.\n\nThe CPIH assessment report was published on 3 March 2016^11^. The report includes a number of requirements that need to be implemented for CPIH to regain its status as a National Statistic. ONS reported to the UK Statistics Authority on 26th September 2016 on the actions that it has taken to address these requirements. ONS will be publishing the new CPIH supporting documentation in October 2016, which will be used over a period of time to monitor the behaviour of the index, and increase awareness and confidence in CPIH. We hope for CPIH to be awarded National Statistic status in the first half of 2017. \n\nAs part of the reassessment process, we have used the Authority’s Administrative Data Quality Assurance Toolkit^12^  to implement the required level of quality assurance for all sources of administrative data used in CPIH (and CPI). In particular this includes the administrative rental data sources used for OOH. Other publications will include a CPIH Compendium, which provides information for users on the rationale behind rental equivalence and the methodology used to construct it, a Users and Uses article, which details how the various measures of inflation are used and by whom and a quarterly article which compares the different approaches to measuring OOH costs. \n\nBefore CPIH regains its National Statistics status it will be subject to a formal period of close scrutiny before the regulation committee is asked to consider whether ONS has met the requirements and CPIH can be badged as a National Statistic. The National Statistician considers that, subject to regaining its National Statistic status, the CPIH should become the preferred measure of inflation and the focus of ONS commentary.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nEvidence submitted for the CPIH assessment report; September 2016\n\nPublication of CPIH supporting documentation; October 2017\n\nMonitoring period; Late 2016 to Mid 2017\n\nCPIH badged as a National Statistic; TBC\n\n####3.2.5 Inclusion of Council Tax in CPIH\n\n#####Overview\n\nFollowing the 2015 consultation on consumer price statistics, the National Statistician reached the decision that Council Tax (and domestic rates for Northern Ireland) should be included in CPIH and that this should take place with the 2017 basket update.\n\nConsumer price statistics are rarely revised. However, once CPIH has regained its status as a National Statistic, the back series will be revised to re-introduce CPIH on the best possible footing. \n\n#####Implementation\n\nInclusion of council tax in CPIH; March 2017\n\n####3.2.6 Develop a reconciliation between CPIH and RPI and review the existing methodology for reconciliation\n\n#####Overview\n\nWith the move towards making CPIH the preferred measure of inflation, we will develop a reconciliation between CPIH and RPI, and use the opportunity to review the reconciliation method used. We will seek the advice of the Advisory Panel on Consumer Prices – Technical and other expert users. \n\n#####Implementation\n\nReconciliation between CPIH and RPI published; Early 2018\n\nImproved reconciliation method; 2019\n\n####3.2.7 Addressing the formula effect\n\n#####Overview\n\nIn 2010, we made a number of changes to the methodology used to collect clothing prices. These changes meant that the gap between RPI and CPI, which use different formulae at the lowest level of aggregation^13^, widened. \n\nConstructing price indices for clothing items can be problematic. This is because the high product turnover associated with fashion items makes it difficult to identify comparable replacements. We will continue to explore the measurement of clothing prices through analysis of the web scraped clothing data provided by WGSN (see use of alternative data sources), as well as considering other ways that the measurement of clothing price changes could be improved. We will seek the advice of its advisory panels in this matter.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nReport on using WGSN data to create price indices; Mid 2017\n\nFurther research into clothing price indices; 2019\n\n###3.3 Medium priority items\n\nMedium priority items form an important part of the work programme but if necessary delivery may be delayed for high priority items. Medium priority items are listed in order of implementation (of the first deliverable).\n\n####3.3.1 Short-term European compliance issues\n\n#####Overview\n\nThe UK CPI is also the UK’s Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). The HICP is a measure of inflation produced by all EU member states in line with EU regulations. We are working to ensure compliance in a number of areas including:\n\n- introducing a lower level of aggregation, called COICOP5\n\n- implementing a temporal sample for fresh fruit and vegetables\n\n- addressing compliance issues related to the double chain link\n\nCOICOP5 (Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose) is a new level of disaggregation which sits below the class (or COICOP4) level indices already published. The need to introduce these changes into CPI is driven by the implementation of new European legislation. COICOP5 will be introduced in CPI and CPIH in March 2017.\n\nPrices for fresh fruit and vegetables are collected on a single Index Day, a Tuesday, in or around the middle of the month. To address temporal sampling requirements, a second collection day for fresh fruit and vegetables is in pilot. In 2016, the pilot was rolled out to a full collection with implementation in the CPI and CPIH in 2018, following a parallel run in 2017. The results and recommendations for implementation will be presented to the Advisory Panels for Consumer Prices in 2017 for consideration.\n\nThe CPI (and CPIH) uses a double chain link to introduce new class level weights in January, and new item level weights in February. Eurostat has been considering whether this approach is compliant with HICP regulations. An independent report written for Eurostat on this issue concluded that ONS should price-update weights twice a year to remove differences between the UK CPI and European HICP methodologies. In a meeting with Eurostat in December 2015 it was agreed that ONS would implement the recommendation for the HICP. As the UK CPI and HICP are one and the same the change will also apply to the CPI and CPIH.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nIntroduction of COICOP5; March 2017\n\nImplementation of price-updated weights twice a year; March 2017\n\nIntroduction of temporal sampling for fresh fruit and vegetables; Early 2018\n\n####3.3.2 Developing measures of accuracy for CPIH\n\n#####Overview\n\nDue to the complex survey design, calculating standard errors for CPIH and specifically the growth in CPIH is very challenging. \n\nThere are 2 dimensions to the sampling: selection of items and selection of outlets.  The sampling involves purposive sampling of both items and outlets. The CPIH weights come from a variety of sources. Some are administrative sources, some are survey-based. They are then put through national accounts balancing. This all makes the estimation of sampling errors difficult.\n\nAlso, CPI weights are price-updated using movements in the appropriate CPI index, so there is an interaction between weights and prices.  Annual rates of change in the price index are ratio estimates, usually over a chain link, so there may be correlations between prices in successive periods that need to be taken into account.\n\nEstimates of the variance due to the variance in the LCF data used as weights are currently being investigated. These will give an indication of some part of the accuracy of CPIH. \n\n#####Implementation\n\nSurvey methodology bulletin article on standard errors arising from expenditure weights; Quarter 2 2017\n\nFurther analysis and refinement; Quarter 1 2018\n\nEstimates of the sampling errors associated with central items; Quarter 3 2018\n\n####3.3.3 Monitoring of quality adjustment and quality change\n\n#####Overview\n\nOne of the more difficult issues in producing consumer price inflation statistics is the accurate measurement and treatment of quality change due to changing product specifications. The Johnson Review considered quality change and recommended ONS provides more information to explain how quality change is monitored. In response to the 2015 consultation on consumer price statistics some users suggested that ONS should devote more resources to improving and monitoring methods of quality adjustment. In particular the quality adjustment of services could be given more consideration. The Bean Review^14^ also considered quality change and found that the issue is likely to grow in importance with the “spreading tentacles of the digital revolution”.\n \nTo address these findings we will launch a project to review quality adjustment methods used in consumer price inflation statistics and provide more detail on how quality adjustment is monitored. \n\n#####Implementation\n\nReport on quality adjustment methods used and how quality adjustment is monitored; Late 2017\n\n####3.3.4 Improvements to CPIH methodology\n\n#####Overview\n\nThere are a number of ways in which the owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) component of CPIH could be further improved. We intend to explore these potential developments to further improve the effectiveness of CPIH as a measure of inflation. These are described in this section.\n\nWhen the OOH component in CPIH was developed in 2011 using administrative data sources for England, Wales and Scotland, comparable rental data for Northern Ireland were not suitable. At the time the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) received private rental data biannually, covering the Belfast Metropolitan Region only. As a result the existing CPI private rental data series for Northern Ireland has continued to be used. Since then the coverage across Northern Ireland has improved and the data are now available monthly. ONS has received an extract of these data from NIHE and started analysis with the ultimate aim of producing a rental index suitable for inclusion in OOH in 2018.\n\nCurrently, dwelling stock data from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) are used to mix- adjust rental data to reflect the OOH market. However, the property type split is not available on a regional basis, so the same property type split is applied across all regions. We will explore other potential sources of data to improve the stratification.\n\nThe Johnson Review^15^ identified that recent research into the measurement of rental equivalence has suggested using a flow measure (new lets only), rather than a stock measure (new and existing lets). We will also explore the appropriateness of using this new approach to measuring rental equivalence costs.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nNew rental data source for Northern Ireland implemented in OOH; Early 2018\n\nImproved property type split for stratum weights; 2018\n\nPresent findings from investigation into stock and flow measures of rental equivalence; 2019\n\n####3.3.5 Improvement to the transparency of CPI and CPIH\n\n#####Overview\n\nThe Johnson Review made 2 recommendations around transparency, specifically the review suggested that ONS provide more information to explain:\n\n- why prices for some items are sourced from the internet, while others are obtained from local shop-based collections^16^\n- what criteria are applied when deciding on the formula used to combine items at the lowest level of aggregation^17^\n\nTo address these recommendations we will review how these decisions are made and publish information on how this works in practice.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nImprovement to the transparency of CPI and CPIH; Mid 2018\n\n####3.3.6 Regional indices\n\n#####Overview\n\nRelative Regional Consumer Price Levels (RRCPL) are an example of a spatial price index which can be used to compare relative price levels to the UK for the 9 regions of England, as well as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. ONS published RRCPLs every 6 years using data collected to calculate Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Spatial Adjustment Factors (SAF). The next SAF collection is taking place in 2016 and the data may potentially be used to publish the RRCPL in 2017.\n\nThe regular collection of prices for consumer price inflation statistics is optimised for measuring inflation at the UK level. Prices are collected locally in 141 locations spread across Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the 9 regions of England. As a result, the number of locations visited per region is small, making the data less suitable for regional indices. Additionally, the prices for many products are collected centrally with no regional breakdown. The viability of using the existing price data to produce more geographically disaggregated price indices will be re-assessed.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nFeasibility report on the creation of regional breakdowns of consumer price indices; Mid 2018\n\n####3.3.7 Location boundary review\n\n#####Overview\n\nThe current sample frame used to select locations for the local price collection was drawn over 10 years ago. While the sample has been updated using rotation of locations and selection of outlets, the location boundaries need to be updated to reflect changing expenditure patterns.\n\nFour new locations boundaries are being piloted in 2016 and in 2017 and 2018 another 8 and 15 new location boundaries will be piloted respectively. Depending on feedback received from collectors in the field, the new boundaries could be rolled-out over a 5-year period starting in 2019. Advice will be sought from the Advisory Panels for Consumer Prices in 2018.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nRoll-out of new boundaries; January 2019\n\n###3.4 Low priority items\n\nThe delivery of low priority items may be delayed or even stopped to ensure the delivery of high and medium priority items. Low priority items are listed in order of implementation (of the first deliverable).\n\n####3.4.1 Discounts\n\n#####Overview\n\nRetailers are offering an increasing array of discounts to attract customers. Single product discounts (available to all consumers without conditions) are captured in consumer price statistics. However, many other types of discounts, such as multi-buy offers or loyalty schemes are excluded. The Johnson Review recognised the difficultly of accurately reflecting all discounts in consumer price statistics and recommended that ONS carry out more work in this area, ultimately seeking to reflect a wider range of discounts in its consumer prices statistics. \n\nIn 2017, we will pilot the collection of discounts data on items which are already collected locally. Field collectors will be asked to record information on discounts (including multibuy discounts) on the handheld devices. The pilot will be run on all food and drink items, with the facility to expand to other product groups in the future. The functionally on the handheld devices has been developed, and field testing is currently underway. In the interim, web scraped data is being used to explore the prevalence of discounts for the 3 supermarkets collected. \n\n#####Implementation\n\nPilot discount collection; January 2017\n\nAnalysis of discounts in web scraped data; 2017\n\nAnalysis of discount data collected locally; 2018\n\nImplement outcome of pilot; 2020\n\n####3.4.2 Weights\n\n#####Overview\n\nThe Johnson Review made a number of recommendations to improve the weights used in consumer price inflation statistics. In early 2014, we improved the commentary in the annual weights article to explain why weights differ and the publication was also brought forward to coincide with the implementation of the annual weights in the consumer price inflation publication. The review also recommended that ONS consider:\n\n- whether weights for some items should be based on more than one year of data to smooth irregular movements (and what causes those movements)^18^\n \n- whether the stratification of items by shop type can be improved^19^\n\nWe have developed a proposal to use a 3-year moving average to smooth the weights for 3 volatile items with irregular movement in the CPI and CPIH baskets. Insurance weights are currently based on 3 years’ data, although this is due to the insurance regulation rather than volatility. The Advisory Panel for Consumer Prices – Technical considered these proposals in May 2016, and we will be conducting more analysis.\n\nWe will also seek to introduce an appropriate stratification where weights for different types of shops are available and can be updated. \n\n#####Implementation\n\nFurther analysis on smoothing volatile weights in the CPI and CPIH; 2017\n\nUpdate shop type weights in the CPI and CPIH; Early 2018\n\n####3.4.3. Medium-term European compliance issues\n\n#####Overview\n\nThe UK CPI is also the UK’s Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). The HICP is a measure of inflation produced by all EU member states in line with EU regulations. We are working to ensure compliance in a number of areas. Specific items^20^ within CPI and CPIH which are being considered for improvement are:\n\n- package holidays\n\n- airfares\n\nIn 2015, Eurostat published the UK Compliance Report^21^ which stated that ONS’s method for package holiday collection is non-compliant. This is because price relatives for package holidays are calculated by comparing the price in the current month with the price the same month a year ago, rather than comparing the price with January. Additionally, in 2014, Eurostat made recommendations for the treatment of airfares and package holidays which highlighted several possible areas for improvement including last-minute deals, booking fees, treatment of seasonal items and booking methods.\n\nIn the UK, airfares are a particularly volatile index and we are investigating whether volatility due to one-off events, such as Easter and school holidays, could be better captured with a temporal collection of airfare prices. \n\n#####Implementation\n\nImplementation of improvements to airfares; Early 2018\n\nImplementation of improvement to package holidays; 2019\n\n####3.4.4 Develop alternatives to the use of RPI data\n\n#####Overview\n\nFollowing the 2015 consultation on consumer price statistics, the National Statistician decided that ONS would publish the bare minimum of RPI-related data necessary to ensure the critical and essential needs of existing users are met. To aid users in finding alternatives to the use of RPI data we will:\n\n- develop a new method for calculating average prices using CPIH\n\n- shift the long run (1750 onwards) inflation series from RPI to CPIH\n\n- update the personal inflation indicator (PIC) to CPIH\n\n- develop and publish a hierarchy of historical indices\n\n#####Implementation\n\nAlternatives developed to the use of RPI data; Mid 2018\n\n####3.4.5 Improvements to OOH(NA)\n\n#####Overview\n\nWe currently produce an experimental net acquisitions index for Eurostat, as part of a pilot to incorporate owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) costs into the HICP. Currently there is no weight for the component “existing dwellings new to the household” sector, which means that it is given a zero weight in the aggregation. Moreover, the weight for the “acquisition of new dwellings” component includes new dwellings outside the OOH sector (that is, the weight is gross acquisitions, rather than net). Wewill explore data sources that could be used to improve this experimental index.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nImproved methodology for the net acquisitions index; 2019\n\n####3.4.6 The extent to which consumers substitute between outlets\n\n#####Overview\n\nThe Johnson Review recommended that ONS should research the extent to which consumers substitute between outlets. For example, this would capture how prices for the same goods have changed with the move from corner shops to supermarkets and from supermarkets to online providers.\n\n#####Implementation\n\nReport on the extent to which consumers substitute between outlets; 2019\n\n######Notes for Work programme:\n\n1.

OOH are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. This is distinct from the cost of purchasing a house which is partly for the accumulation of wealth and partly for housing services.\n\nThere is not a single defined measure of OOH because they can be calculated differently depending on what the target is. In particular, should OOH be measured at the point of acquisition of the housing service, the point of use, or the point at which it is paid for? Each of these 3 approaches has its own specific methodological strengths and weaknesses, and is measured using different methods. ","title":"A brief description of owner occupiers’ housing costs"},{"markdown":"###What is the payments approach?\n\nThe payments approach aims to measure the payments related to the ownership of owner occupier housing. This means that all payments that households make as owner occupiers when consuming housing should be included, such as mortgage interest payments, transaction costs, and running costs. The payments approach is not our favoured method to measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) in CPIH. This is because a consumer prices index aims to measure consumption, and interest payments represent the cost of borrowing money rather than the cost of consumption. \n\nOOH(Payments) is an experimental series, and we therefore advise using it with some caution. We are continuing to work on identifying possible improvements to the current methodology and data sources. Any changes to the index will be highlighted in future releases and we will update the methodology section and historical series accordingly. For more information on the current methodology and data sources used to construct the OOH(Payments) approach, please see Annex 1A.\n\n####Payments approach\n\nThe payments approach is calculated using the below model:\n\nPayments approach = Mortgage interest payments<br>\n                    + Council Tax (Great Britain)<br>\n                    + Northern Ireland rates<br>\n                    + Dwelling Insurance<br>\n                    + Ground rent<br>\n                    + Stamp duty<br>\n                    + Estate agent fees<br>\n                    + Home-buyers survey<br>\n                    + Major repairs and maintenance<br>\n                    + House conveyancing\n\nA correction has been made to OOH(Payments) since the previous release in December 2016. This was due to a small error when aggregating the sub-indices. The previous releases have all been updated to reflect this change.\n\n###Latest figure and long-term trend\t\n\nOwner occupiers’ housing costs compiled using the payments approach - OOH(Payments) - experienced growth of 0.3% in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2016 compared with Quarter 4 2015 (Figure 1). This fell from Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2016, but remains in line with historical trends. \n\nFigure 2 presents the contributions to the quarterly growth rate of OOH(Payments) from the sub-indices used in its construction. Looking at contributions to growth is helpful to provide insight into the main drivers behind the year-on-year changes in the series. The fall from Quarter 3 to Quarter 4 was largely driven by an increase in the negative contribution from mortgage interest rates, which remain the largest negative contributor. The drop in the Bank of England base rate to 0.25% in August 2016 may have contributed towards this. Council Tax was the highest positive contributor, which is in line with recent quarters.\n\nFor a longer time series of contributions, please see the [dataset][1] presented alongside this release.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"77b7505e\" />\n\n<ons-chart path=\"644839b2\" />\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcosts","title":"Payments"},{"markdown":"###What is the net acquisitions approach?\n\nThe net acquisitions approach – OOH(NA) – theoretically treats a home as the purchase of a good that is part asset (the land) and part consumable (the house). Asset prices should not be included in a consumer price index (which measures the cost of consumption), as an asset is not consumed in the same way that goods and services are. Therefore, the land component should be excluded from the index. OOH(NA) also includes costs associated with buying and maintaining a house; for example, self-builds and renovations, repairs and maintenance, transfer costs and dwelling insurance. The “net” principle in net acquisitions relates to the fact that only transactions that occur between the OOH sector and other sectors (for example, construction firms and private landlords) should be included.\n\nIn practice, while the measure presented here is the best measure of the net acquisitions approach that we can currently produce, the lack of available source data means that some components are not recorded fully. For instance, because of the lack of available data, the methodology used does not separate between the land and house price, and therefore there will be some measure of asset price included in the example. We therefore advise that OOH(NA) should be used and referred to with caution, and it is consequently not our favoured approach of measuring OOH in CPIH. As with the OOH(Payments) approach, it is an experimental index and we will continue to work on improving the methodology and data sources used in the index. For more information on the methodology used to construct OOH(NA), please see Annex 1B.\n\n####Net acquisitions approach\n\nThe net acquisitions approach is calculated using the below model:\n\nNet acquisitions approach = Acquisition of new dwellings<br>\n\t\t+ Self builds and renovations<br>\n\t\t+ Existing dwellings new to the OOH sector<br>\n\t\t+ Services related to acquisition<br>\n\t\t+ Major repairs and maintenance <br>\n\t\t+ Insurance connected with the dwelling<br>\n\t\t+ Other services related to ownership of dwellings\n\n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe net acquisitions approach – OOH(NA) – grew by 2.0% in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2016 compared with Quarter 4 2015. This is lower than the 2.1% growth rate for Quarter 3 2016 but is still in line with historical trends (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 4 shows the contributions to quarter on corresponding quarter of previous year growth rate for OOH(NA). While new dwellings continued to be the main driver of the increase in OOH(NA), its contributions to the growth rate have halved since Quarter 2. The input data for the new dwellings series is the HPI, which has seen a fall in the 12-month growth rate since July 2016 although there was a slight upward tick in December 2016. This demonstrates one of the main limitations of the current method of measuring net acquisitions, which is that movements in the asset price are not excluded from the index and can therefore influence some of the main trends shown in the data.\n\nFor a longer time series of contributions, please see the [dataset][1] presented alongside this release.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"9be1f959\" />\n\n<ons-chart path=\"4ac8ad8b\" />\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/understandingthedifferentapproachesofmeasuringowneroccupiershousingcosts","title":"Net acquisitions"},{"markdown":"###What is the rental equivalence approach?\n\nThe final section presents the rental equivalence approach to measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs – OOH(RE), which targets the measurement of ongoing consumption of OOH services, rather than when OOH is acquired or when it is paid for. As a consumer price index, CPIH is a measure of the cost of consumption. Therefore the choice of method for measuring OOH should be based on the most statistically accurate method for measuring the cost of consumption in the UK. This means that asset prices should not be included, as an asset is not consumed in the way that goods and services are. The rental equivalence approach is our preferred method for measuring OOH costs in CPIH because the other approaches include either a measure of interest rates, or some measure of the capital element of housing, which make them unsuitable for a price index that measures the changing cost of consumption. The approach is also based on a higher quality data source than the other approaches presented in this article, allowing for a more reliable estimate of the measure. For more information about why the rental equivalence is used in CPIH, please see the [CPIH compendium][1].\n\n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nOOH(RE) grew by 2.6% in December 2016 compared with December 2015 (Figure 5). This continued the upward trend in 12-month growth rate of OOH(RE) seen since the end of 2015 and began to reach similar levels of growth seen prior to the economic downturn in 2008. On a quarterly basis for consistency with OOH(Payments) and OOH(NA), OOH(RE) grew by 2.6% in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2016 compared with the corresponding quarter of the previous year, up from 2.4% in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2016.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"1b65978d\" />\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/qmis/consumerpriceinflationqmi","title":"Rental equivalence"},{"markdown":"Although there is not a single defined measure of OOH, and each of the methods discussed prior measure different aspects of OOH, it is still useful to look at the 3 measures together to see how they differ over time.\n\nThe cumulative measure of all 3 approaches is presented in Figure 6. It suggests that since 2005, OOH(NA) has shown the strongest growth over the period. OOH(Payments) saw strong growth prior to the economic downturn due to the large positive contributions from the growth in mortgage interest payments (Figure 6). Of the 3 measures, it has also seen the largest fall since the economic downturn, again driven by the falling price of mortgage interest payments and has still not recovered its pre-downturn peak.\n\nOOH(RE) appears at a lag to the OOH(NA) and OOH(Payments) approaches for the peak and trough before and after the economic downturn. This lag is because OOH(RE) is a “stock” measure of rents. This means that it captures price information for the entire stock of rental properties, which includes existing contracted properties and properties that are new to the market. Therefore, the flow of new rents based on recent developments in house prices will only gradually influence its development because the stock of existing dwellings is so much larger. This also means that the relative peaks and troughs of OOH(RE) will be subdued relative to OOH(NA) because the large stock of contracted rental properties is likely to mute the impact of volatile house prices.\n\n<ons-image path=\"74aa0784\" />\n\nThe lag for OOH(RE) is not a disadvantage to using the rental equivalence approach in the calculation of the owner occupier’s housing costs component in CPIH. This is because the rental equivalence approach aims to measure the housing services that are consumed each period (consistent with the principles that underlie the construction of CPIH) and therefore does not need to follow the trend of house prices. If consideration is required of house prices, the HPI should be used instead.","title":"Comparing the different approaches of measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs"},{"markdown":"To calculate CPIH, the owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) component measured using the rental equivalence approach is aggregated together with other items in the fixed basket of goods and services. Expenditure weights for the OOH component comes from the National Accounts household final consumption expenditure (HHFCE) data on imputed rentals. In turn, this is taken from the latest available national accounts dataset, which is published in Quarter 3, and is consistent with the most recent Blue Book release (typically published in June or September). Thus for a given year y, the expenditure shares are based on the Blue Book release y-1, which publishes data for year y-2.\n\nNational accounts estimates are open for revisions, and therefore there can be differences between the initial expenditure estimates used to calculate the OOH weights and revised expenditure totals for each year provided in subsequent Blue Book releases. This spotlight aims to provide an overview of the revisions that have affected the HHFCE imputed rentals series. This has also been summarised in the [CPIH Compendium Section 2.4.2][1]. For more information, please see the [Changes to National Accounts: Imputed Rental (2016)][2] article as well as [Blue Book 2013: Improvements to Household Expenditure Estimates][3].\n\nFigure 7 provides an overview of Blue Book consistent published expenditure for the HHFCE imputed rentals component. Each line represents a different vintage of Blue Book data and its respective historical series. For example, the line for Blue Book 2016 (BB2016) covers yearly expenditure from 2002 to 2015. The lines are grouped according to important changes to methodology and data sources. The red lines indicate vintages of Blue Book between 2004 and 2012. The blue lines are between 2013 and 2015, while the orange top line is consistent with Blue Book 2016.\n\nThe bars in Figure 7 represent the differences in total expenditure between the first publication of data for that year and the latest Blue Book vintage. Specifically, we divide the bars into changes from BB2004 to BB2012 (red), BB2012 to BB2015 (blue) and BB2015 to BB2016 (orange). These illustrate the different magnitudes of revisions implemented, in particular for Blue Book 2013 and Blue Book 2016.\n\n<ons-image path=\"9954e316\" />\n\n###Blue Book 2004 to Blue Book 2012 \n\nThe revisions to imputed rentals expenditure leading up to Blue Book 2012 (red bars) have not been large relative to subsequent revisions, and have mainly been due to minor data changes. The largest difference over this period was for 2004, which was revised upwards by 6% between Blue Book 2005 and Blue Book 2012. \n\n###Blue Book 2013 to Blue Book 2015 \n\nThe blue bars in Figure 7 show that there has been a noticeable level shift in total expenditure for imputed rentals from Blue Book 2012 to Blue Book 2013. This is due to expenditure revisions that occurred due to changes in the methodology. In particular, prior to the release of Blue Book 2013 there had been a large development project on the treatment of “Imputed rentals on owner-occupied dwellings” and “Maintenance and repairs of the dwelling”. The aim of these improvements was to ensure increased compliance with ESA95. The changes were implemented in Blue Book 2013 and involved changes to the treatment of imputed rentals on owner-occupied dwellings. The change ensured that maintenance and repairs expenditure was included within imputed rentals expenditure. \n\nThere were further changes to expenditure between Blue Book 2013 and Blue Book 2014. When CPIH was introduced in 2013, it showed a different evolution in prices for owner-occupiers’ compared to the implied deflator^1^ used in the National Accounts. An interim solution was implemented in Blue Book 2014, fixing the current price imputed rental series so that it grew in line with the slower-growing CPIH deflator. This improvement was implemented for 2010 onwards, as only this period was open for revision at the point of introduction. Although this improved the series for the most recent period, bringing it in line with CPIH, it also led to a discontinuity until an improved methodology was introduced in Blue Book 2016. This is what caused the jump between 2009 and 2010 in Figure 7 for the BB2014 and BB2015 series.\n\n###Blue Book 2016\n\nThe large expenditure shift between Blue Book 2015 and Blue Book 2016 in Figure 7 can be mostly attributed to data source changes and minor complementary methodological changes. Before Blue Book 2016, the existing estimates of imputed rental expenditures (current prices) were based on price information from the Living Costs and Food (LCF) survey and housing stock levels from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). A new approach was implemented in Blue Book 2016 that uses Valuation Office Agency (VOA) data together with similar data from the devolved administrations instead of the LCF price data^2^. The VOA and DCLG data are also forecast to the latest period (where data are not yet available) at the strata level using standard [ONS forecasting principles][4]. As well as data changes, some changes were made to the calculation of the imputed rental series due to more robust VOA data (see [article][5] and section 2.4 of the [CPIH compendium][6]).\n\nWhen creating weights for OOH in CPIH for 2015, an early, non-systematised estimate of the imputed rentals expenditure consistent with this new Blue Book 2016 methodology was provided to Prices by National Accounts. This was instead of using the Blue Book 2014 data, as is standard practice. The offline expenditure allowed for the 2015 OOH weights within CPIH to be created on the new Blue Book 2016 basis. As [improvements to the OOH index][7] were being introduced in CPIH, the weights for imputed rentals were also revised backwards to ensure that there was no significant step change (see [Changes to National Accounts: Imputed Rental article][8]). This allowed Prices to mitigate the level shift in the underlying expenditure that was expected to occur between Blue Book 2015 and 2016 expenditure estimates and would have affected the OOH weights in CPIH.\n\nIn 2016, the weights for OOH were calculated based on a new set of preliminary estimates of the Blue Book 2016 consistent expenditure. These were different to the ones provided in 2015. However, these expenditure estimates were only used for the creation of 2016 weights and were not revised backwards to take on board this new set of expenditure estimates.\n\nThese preliminary estimates from National Accounts were slightly different to the final expenditure figures published in Blue Book 2016. As part of a package of improvements being introduced to CPIH in March 2017, it was decided that the OOH weights should be revised to ensure that the expenditure underlying the OOH weights within CPIH were consistent with Blue Book 2016 and remove the use of the offline estimates provided by National Accounts. It would also ensure that the price updating procedure applied to the historical expenditure figures for OOH are the same as the one that will be applied going forward. Overall, this ensures that the expenditure data is as up to date as possible and that the methods used are consistent. For the impact of using the finalised figures from Blue Book 2016 please see “[Impact of inclusion of Council Tax and revised imputed rents on CPIH][9]”.\n\n###Summary\n\nFigure 8 summarises the timeline of these revisions. Orange circles indicate that there have been routine data revisions, blue circles indicate cases where there have been methodological changes, red circles highlight revisions to the CPIH weights and finally white circles denote other notable changes. \n\n<ons-image path=\"5e88ea68\" />\n\nIn summary, historical data revisions have not been large (as evidenced by the changes experienced up to Blue Book 2012); however, given that the methodology has been improved it is difficult to say what these data revisions will look like in the future. There are some further [methodological changes planned for Blue Book 2017][10], although these are small compared to recent movement. There are also no further methodological changes planned for imputed rentals. As such, revisions to national accounts data should be smaller than those shown in the blue and orange bars in Figure 7. We therefore do not expect to revise the expenditure weights for OOH in the foreseeable future.\n\n####Notes for: Spotlight: Revisions to OOH(RE) expenditure weights\n\n1. An implied deflator is a measure derived by dividing a current price expenditure series by the volume series. For more information on the implied deflator refer to this [article][11].\n\n2. These sources have much larger sample sizes than the LCF (for example, around 500,000 properties per year in the VOA data), and this also allows the use of an improved methodology using stratification. In contrast, the LCF data are based on around 400 households’ rental prices per quarter.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/cpihcompendium/2016-10-13#section-2-constructing-the-rental-equivalence-measure-of-ooh\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/changestonationalaccounts/imputedrental\n  [3]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171766_315500.pdf\n  [4]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/gss-methodology-series/ons-working-paper-series/index.html\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/changestonationalaccounts/imputedrental\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/cpihcompendium/2016-10-13\n  [7]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/improvements-to-the-measurement-of-owner-occupiers--housing-costs-and-private-housing-rental-prices/index.html\n  [8]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/revising-the-weight-of-owner-occupiers--housing-in-cpih/index.html\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/impactofinclusionofcounciltaxandrevisedimputedrentsoncpih/dec2016\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/nationalaccountsarticles/actualandimputedrentalbluebook2017\n  [11]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/mini-triennial-review-of-the-consumer-prices-index-and-retail-prices-index.pdf","title":"Spotlight: Revisions to OOH(RE) expenditure weights"},{"markdown":"The payments approach is an experimental method for measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH)  that attempts to capture what households pay out as owner occupiers when consuming housing (excluding capital repayments). This includes mortgage interest payments, transaction costs such as estate agency fees and legal fees, and running costs such as repairs and maintenance, ground rent and dwelling insurance.\n\nTable A1 presents a full list of the OOH(Payments) component indices, as well as the source data for the prices and weights information used to construct the index. Most of the indices are drawn from the Retail Prices Index (RPI), which can be said to follow a payments approach to measuring OOH. One of the problems for the payments approach is to account for major repairs and maintenance, which are difficult to obtain prices for on a consistent basis. One method of dealing with this problem is the approach taken in the RPI, which includes a component for the depreciation of the property. The approach was characterised as estimating the amount of money households should put aside for necessary major repairs and updating in order to maintain the value of the property. The method used here, which is more in line with a true payments approach, is to include a major repairs and maintenance component, proxied by the regular repairs and maintenance series in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) due to lack of alternative data source.\n\nThe other sub-index which does not come from the RPI is the Stamp Duty Index. This has been constructed for the OOH(NA) approach (see Annex 1B), and uses national accounts gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) and household final consumption expenditure (HHFCE) as the source data for the expenditure weights. \n\n<ons-table path=\"375f9506\" />","title":"Annex 1A: Payments methodology"},{"markdown":"The net acquisitions approach is an experimental method for measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) that are associated with the purchase and ongoing ownership of dwellings for own use. As the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) does not cover investment spending, the net acquisitions approach treats a home as the purchase of a good that is part asset (the land) and part consumable (the house) and excludes the land component from the index. OOH(NA) also includes costs associated with buying and maintaining a house; for example, self-builds and renovations, repairs and maintenance, transfer costs and dwelling insurance. The method we use to calculate OOH(NA) was proposed by Eurostat. It groups sub-indices measuring different aspects of OOH costs into 2 classes; those related to the acquisition of dwellings and those related to the ownership of dwellings.\n\nThe ideal method for excluding the land component in OOH(NA) is the net-net approach, whereby prices and weights both exclude the land component from the house purchase. However, as many member states (including the UK) are unable to implement the net-net approach due to a lack of available data, Eurostat requires all member states to use the net-gross (net weight, gross price) approach. This includes the use of the House Price Index (HPI), which does not separate between the land and house price, within the “Acquisition of New Dwellings” and “Existing Dwellings New to the OOH Sector” components. This means that the net acquisitions approach presented here will include some measure of asset price in the index.\n\nIn addition to the HPI, Table A2 presents the other sources of component price indices. With the exception of the Stamp Duty Index, all are drawn from some of our existing publications, including the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI) and Retail Prices Index (RPI). More information about each of the sub-indices is available.\n\nTable A2 also shows that the component expenditure weights used to compile OOH(NA) are derived from the national accounts gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) and household final consumption expenditure (HHFCE). The “net” principle in net acquisitions relates to the fact that only transactions that occur between the OOH sector and other sectors (for example, construction firms and private landlords) should be included. However, we cannot currently distinguish between sectors and therefore the weight for “Acquisition of New Dwellings” includes expenditure on all newly constructed dwellings and not those specifically destined for the OOH sector as per the methodology outlined by Eurostat. In addition, a weight for “Existing Dwellings New to the OOH Sector” does not exist; therefore, a 0 weight is currently applied. The “Other services related to ownership of dwellings” is based on the national accounts series 04.4.4 “Other services relating to the dwelling” and has zero expenditure recorded in Blue Book 2016. It therefore has a weight of 0 in the net acquisitions approach, and is excluded from the calculation.\n\n<ons-table path=\"e5a52e71\" />","title":"Annex 1B: Net acquisitions methodology"},{"markdown":"The rental equivalence approach is a method for measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) at the point at which the services provided by OOH are consumed. \n\nRental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. The rent charged by landlords covers not just the property but many of the other costs borne by owner occupiers, such as repairs and maintenance and transaction costs. Therefore, under the rental equivalence approach, these are not estimated separately, as to do so would introduce double-counting. The rental equivalence approach also does not capture changes in asset value; rather it measures the change in price of housing services provided.\n\nThe rental equivalence approach uses private rental data from the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) and supplemented with data from the devolved administrations. The data are stratified regionally as well as by property type (detached, semi-detached, terraced, or flat or maisonette) and whether the property is furnished or unfurnished. For each stratum, elementary aggregates are calculated which are then weighted together to create an aggregate index.\n\nThe private rental data are used in both the calculation of the owner occupiers’ housing costs component in CPIH (the rental equivalence approach) and the Index of Private Housing Rental Prices (IPHRP). The difference between the indices stems from the different weights used to combine the elementary aggregates. Strata weights for OOH(RE) are designed to represent the owner-occupied market and strata weights for IPHRP are designed to represent the private rental market. For example, looking at the range of housing available on the market, there would be a larger proportion of typical rental properties (for example, 1-bedroom flats), and the weights calculated would reflect this mix. By comparison, the owner occupied housing weights will reflect the larger proportion of more typically purchased properties (for example, 3-bedroom detached houses). Expenditure weights are calculated by multiplying dwelling stock counts for the owner occupied sector or private rental sector by average rental prices.\n\nFor a more detailed overview of the rental equivalence approach methodology, please see the [CPIH compendium][1].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/cpihcompendium/2016-10-13","title":"Annex 1C: Rental equivalence methodology"},{"markdown":"In January 2017, we published a stand-alone piece of analysis which aggregated the different approaches to measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH) with the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) to create a hybrid aggregate inflation measure which includes OOH as measured by each approach: [Understanding the different approaches of measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH): Weights analysis][1].\n\nFrom March 2017, CPIH was extended to include council tax. To ensure that CPIH is of the best possible quality, the full back series of CPIH has been revised to incorporate council tax and revised weights for OOH using the rental equivalence approach.

The [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables (2.49 Mb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/april-2015/consumer-price-inflation-reference-table.xls \"Consumer Price Inflation Reference Table\") are provided via an Excel file.\n\n\tTo help users further, very detailed CPI data are now available on our website including the [individual price quotes and item indices](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi-item-indices-and-price-quotes/index.html \"Consumer Prices Indices (CPI) and Retail Prices Index (RPI) item and price quotes\") that underpin the CPI. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. The data published covers January 1996 to December 2014. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the May CPI is published on 16 June 2015, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to March 2015.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each Member State of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of April 2015 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 19 May 2015. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/international/eurostat-s-data-tables.html \"Eurostat's Data Tables\"). Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/hicp/overview \"Eurostat's HICP web page\"). \n\n3. **Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation**\n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services (139.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi-basket-of-goods-and-services/cpi-2015-basket-of-goods.pdf \"CPI 2015 Basket of Goods\") . The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights (431.9 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi--updating-weights/2015.pdf \"2015\") .\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices, which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables (2.49 Mb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/april-2015/consumer-price-inflation-reference-table.xls \"Consumer Price Inflation Reference Table\") . By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the  [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/consumer-price-indices-technical-manual--2014.pdf \"Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual, 2014\") .

The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n5. **Publication policy**\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the April 2015 data, collected on and around 14 April 2015.

The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to April 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between April 2014 and April 2015.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets.

This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in April 2014 would have cost £99.90 in April 2015. This is the first time that the CPI 12-month rate has been negative since official records began in 1996.\n\nAn annual fall in prices is often referred to as \"negative inflation\" or \"deflation\". Based on comparable historic estimates, the last time the UK saw consumer price deflation was in the year to March 1960, when prices fell by an estimated 0.6%.\n\nIn the year to April 2015, food prices fell by 3.0% and prices of motor fuels fell by 12.3%. In both cases, the falls are smaller than in the year to March 2015 but the 2 groups still provided the largest downward contributions to the 12-month rate for April. In total, the food and motor fuels groups reduced the CPI 12-month rate by approximately 0.7 percentage points.

The 1-month movement was therefore 0.2 percentage points lower this year compared with a year ago, resulting in a fall in the CPI 12-month rate. The difference between the movements in the annual and monthly rates is due to rounding.\n\nThe largest downward contributions to change in the CPI 12-month rate between March and April 2015 came from price movements for:\n\n- **transport services:** prices, overall, rose by 2.4% between March and April 2015, compared with a larger rise of 7.9% a year earlier.

These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index. CPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier.\n\nOOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn April 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between April 2014 and April 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.2%, down from 0.3% in March 2015. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in April 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in March, despite a small downward contribution from owner occupiers’ housing costs.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn April 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.3%, unchanged from 0.3% in the year to March 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for April 2015 stood at 0.9%, meaning that it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period, the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 34.7% over the 10-year period, compared with 27.7% as measured by the RPIJ.

Improved methodology for owner occupiers’ housing costs in the CPIHY (CPIH excluding indirect taxation) measure of consumer prices has been implemented as part of this release, with the historical series revised back to 2005.\n \n\t**Consultation on consumer price statistics** \n\n\tThe UK Statistics Authority launched a [public consultation][1] on consumer price statistics on 15 June. The consultation follows a [review of consumer price statistics][2] led by Mr Paul Johnson (Director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies) and seeks users' views on the issues raised in that review. After the consultation closes on 15 September, the Authority will summarise the responses and publish a report.\n \n2. **Understanding and accessing the data** \n\n\tA full description of how consumer price indices are compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)][3]. This is supplemented by video, infographics and textual information available from the [guidance and methodology section][4] of our website.\n \n\tA more detailed [quality report  (141.9 Kb Pdf)][5] for this statistical bulletin is available. The report assesses consumer price inflation statistics against standard dimensions of quality such as relevance, accuracy and accessibility. The report was last updated in October 2013.\n \n\tThe [mini Triennial Review (1.75 Mb Pdf)][6] of the CPI and RPI Central Collection of Prices is available.\n \n\tThe most efficient way to access the latest consumer price inflation data and briefing on our website is via the CPI key figure on the [homepage][7].\n \n\tIn response to user feedback, all consumer price inflation data are available in 1 location. The [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables (2.51 Mb Excel sheet)][8] are provided via an Excel file.\n \n\tTo help users further, very detailed CPI data are now available including the [individual price quotes and item indices][9] that underpin the CPI. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. The data published covers January 1996 to March 2015. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the August CPI is published on 15 September 2015, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to June 2015.\n \n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each Member State of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU Member States. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of June 2015 for EU Member States, together with an EU average, on 16 July 2015. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables][10]. Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU Member States is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][11].\n \n3. **Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation** \n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n \n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services (139.4 Kb Pdf)][12]. The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights (431.9 Kb Pdf)][13].\n \n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][14] (2.51 Mb Excel sheet) . By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n \n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)][15]. [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][16] provides further details of how consumer price statistics are used more generally.\n \n4. **Revisions policy** \n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, a [revisions policy (49.6 Kb Pdf)][17] was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n \n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n \n5. **Publication policy** \n\n\tThis bulletin includes the June 2015 data, collected on and around 9 June 2015. [Future publication dates][18] for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2017 (the publication of the December 2016 inflation figures). Publication dates from February 2016 onwards are provisional.\n \n\tDetails of the policy governing the release of new data are available from our Media Relations Office. Also available is a list of the names of those given [pre-release access][19] to the contents of this release.\n \n\tIn line with the Consumer Price Inflation Pre-Release arrangements, an advanced estimate of the CPI was provided to the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer 4 working days ahead of publication. The Governor shared this information with the MPC, and officials present at the MPC meeting, on Wednesday 8 July 2015. The pre-release access to the June CPI figures was extended to 4 working days from 3.5 working days due to the timing of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting being moved forward half a day.\n \n\tConsumer price inflation for July 2014 to July 2015 will be published on 18 August 2015.\n \n\tFollow us on [Twitter][20] or join us at [Facebook][21]. \n \n\tMedia contact:</br> \n\tTel: Luke

or fall. Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n \nA [video][1] and an [infographic][2] explain how consumer price inflation is calculated.\n \nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to June 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between June 2014 and June 2015.\n \nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government’s target for inflation.\n \nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics][1] (100.5 Kb Pdf).\n \n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n \nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between June 2014 and June 2015 stood at 0.0%. This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in June 2014 would still have cost £100.00 in June 2015. This continues the trend of the previous 4 months when inflation had been at or around 0.0%.\n \nIn the year to June 2015, food prices fell by 2.2% and prices of motor fuels fell by 10.5%. These 2 groups, along with audio-visual and related equipment, have provided the largest downward contributions to the 12-month rate in each month of 2015. In June 2015, the food and motor fuels groups in total reduced the CPI 12-month rate by approximately 0.6 percentage points. Historically, price movements for these products have been among the main causes of inflation.

The 1-month movement was therefore 0.2 percentage points lower this year compared with a year ago, resulting in a fall in the CPI 12-month rate. The difference between the movements in the annual and monthly rates is due to rounding.\n \nThe largest downward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between May and June 2015 came from:\n\n- **clothing and footwear:** prices, overall, fell by 0.4% between May and June this year compared with a rise of 0.6% between the same 2 months a year ago\n \n\tPrices usually fall between May and June as the summer sales begin but last year the average prices of a number of products rose. The main downward effect came from garments, particularly women’s outerwear.\n \n\n- **transport:** prices, overall, rose by 0.2% between May and June 2015 compared with a larger rise of 0.6% a year earlier\n \n\tThe downward contribution came from transport services (particularly air transport and, to a lesser extent, sea transport) where fares rose this year but by less than a year ago. This was partially offset by a small upward contribution from motor fuels with average petrol prices rising by 1.1 pence per litre between May and June this year compared with a smaller rise of 0.6 pence per litre a year earlier.

The improvements from the resulting development work were introduced as part of the February 2015 dataset with the historical series revised back to 2005. Further information on the changes is available in 2 articles: [Improvements to the measurement of Owner Occupiers’ Housing Costs and Private Housing Rental Prices (2.48 Mb Pdf)][3] and [Revising the weight of Owner Occupiers’ Housing in CPIH (197.4 Kb Pdf)][4].**\n \nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n \nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n \nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n \nIn June 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between June 2014 and June 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.3%, down from 0.4% in May 2015. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in June 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in May, despite a small upward contribution from owner occupiers’ housing costs.\n \nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the official CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The [full assessment report][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.**\n \nThe RPI is a long-standing measure of UK inflation that has historically been used for a wide range of purposes such as the indexation of pensions, rents and index-linked gilts. For further information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][2].\n \nRPIJ is an improved variant of the Retail Prices Index, which is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n \nIn June 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.4%, unchanged from May 2015.\n \nThe RPI 12-month rate for June 2015 stood at 1.0%, meaning that it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n \nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 34.7% over the 10-year period, compared with 27.7% as measured by RPIJ. The use of the Carli formula has therefore added 7.0 percentage points to the change in prices over the last 10 years.

The note sets out 2 important forthcoming developments for the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and CPIH (a measure of inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs). The first of these is a re-referencing of the indices to 2015=100. The second is the introduction of a more detailed level of sub-category known as COICOP5.\n \n\tThe re-referencing of the indices is due to take place with the publication of the January 2016 data. Regular re-referencing of indices is methodological good practice as it avoids rounding issues that can arise from small index values. Published CPI and CPIH inflation rates are calculated from unrounded indices, meaning that re-referencing will not impact on published inflation rates. Re-referencing will result in revisions to the CPI and CPIH indices. Full back series of the revised indices will be published, with further details to come later this year. Users of indices (as opposed to inflation rates) will want to ensure that, in using these data to calculate their own rates of inflation, they use indices calculated using the same reference year.\n \n\t**Update on research into web scraping price data**\n\n\tOn 1 September 2015, we are planning to publish an update of our research into producing price indices from web scraped data. The update will include an extension to the time series of the [previously published web scraped data (611.7 Kb ZIP)][2] and an article providing analysis of the different methods for using these data.\n \n\t**Consultation on consumer price statistics**\n\n\tThe UK Statistics Authority launched a [public consultation][3] on consumer price statistics on 15 June. The consultation follows a [review of consumer price statistics][4] led by Mr Paul Johnson (Director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies) and seeks users' views on the issues raised in that review. After the consultation closes on 15 September, the Authority will summarise the responses and publish a report.\n \n2. **Understanding and accessing the data**\n\n\tA full description of how consumer price indices are compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)][5]. This is supplemented by infographics and textual information available from the [guidance and methodology section][6] of our website.\n\n\tA more detailed [quality report (174.5 Kb Pdf)][7] for this statistical bulletin is available. The report assesses consumer price inflation statistics against standard dimensions of quality such as relevance, accuracy and accessibility. The report was last updated in October 2013.\n \n\tThe [mini Triennial Review (1.75 Mb Pdf)][8] of the CPI and RPI Central Collection of Prices is available.\n\n\tThe most efficient way to access the latest consumer price inflation data and briefing on our website is via the CPI key figure on the [homepage][9].\n \n\tIn response to user feedback, all consumer price inflation data are available in 1 location. The [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][10] are provided via an Excel file.\n \n\tTo help users further, very detailed CPI data are now available including the [individual price quotes and item indices][11] that underpin the CPI. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. The data published covers January 1996 to March 2015. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the August CPI is published on 15 September 2015, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to June 2015.\n \n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each member state of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat released figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of July 2015 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 14 August 2015. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables][12]. Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][24].\n \n3. **Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation**\n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n \n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services(139.4 Kb Pdf)][13]. The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights(431.9 Kb Pdf)][14].\n \n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][15]. By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n \n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (49.6 Kb Pdf)][16]. [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][17] provides further details of how consumer price statistics are used more generally.\n \n4. **Revisions policy**\n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, a [revisions policy (49.6 Kb Pdf)][18] was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n \n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n \n5. **Publication policy**\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the July 2015 data, collected on and around 14 July 2015. Future [publication dates][19] for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2018 (the publication of the December 2017 inflation figures). Publication dates from February 2017 onwards are provisional.\n \n\tDetails of the policy governing the release of new data are available from our Media Relations Office. Also available is a list of the names of those given [pre-release access][20] to the contents of this release.\n \n\tConsumer price inflation for August 2014 to August 2015 will be published on 15 September 2015.\n \n\tFollow us on [Twitter][21] or join us at [Facebook][22].\n \n\tMedia contact:</br>\n\tTel:  Luke Croydon   + 44 (0) 845 6041858 </br>\n\tOut of hours media line   + 44 (0) 7867 906553 </br>\n\tEmail:  media.relations@ons.gsi.gov.uk\n\n\tStatistical contact: </br>\n\tTel:  Richard Campbell +44 (0) 1633 651536 </br>\n\tEmail: cpi@ons.gsi.gov.uk \n\n\tConsumer Price Inflation recorded message (available after 9.45am on release day):</br>\n\tTel: + 44 (0) 800 0113703\n \n\tConsumer Price Inflation Enquiries:</br>\n\tTel: + 44 (0) 1633 456900\n\n6.

Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. An [infographic][1] explains how consumer price inflation is calculated. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n \nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to July 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between July 2014 and July 2015.\n \nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government’s target for inflation.\n \nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][1].\n \n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n \nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between July 2014 and July 2015 stood at 0.1%. This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in July 2014 would have cost £100.10 in July 2015. This continues the trend of the previous 5 months when inflation had been at or around 0.0%.\n \nIn the year to July 2015, food prices fell by 2.7% and prices of motor fuels fell by 11.4%. These 2 groups have provided some of the largest downward contributions to the 12-month rate during 2015. In July 2015, the food and motor fuels groups in total reduced the CPI 12-month rate by approximately 0.7 percentage points. Historically, price movements for these products have been among the main causes of inflation. An article was published in November 2014 which outlined some [possible factors that may be affecting prices (477.2 Kb Pdf)][2].\n \nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in July 2015 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.

An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. [Explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (37.1 Kb Pdf)][4] is a diagram explaining the calculation.\n \nThe CPI fell by 0.2% between June and July 2015 compared with a larger fall of 0.3% between the same 2 months a year earlier. The 1-month movement was therefore 0.1 percentage points higher  this year compared with a year ago, resulting in a rise in the CPI 12-month rate.\n \nBy far the largest upward contribution to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between June and July 2015 came from:\n\n- **clothing and footwear:** prices, overall, fell by 3.4% between June and July this year compared with a larger fall of 5.7% between the same 2 months a year ago. Prices always fall between June and July during the summer sales period. The price fall between June and July this year was in line with recent years. However, the price fall between June and July last year was larger than usual between these 2 months and followed an atypical price increase between May and June 2014. At the time there were reports of a shift in the timing of the summer sales compared with previous years. The downward contribution came from price movements across the garments sector\n\nThere were smaller, but notable, upward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate from:\n\n- **transport services:** prices, overall, rose by 6.6% between June and July this year, compared with a smaller rise of 4.6% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward contribution came from most transport fares – notably air fares\n\n- **recreation and culture:** prices, overall, rose by 0.2% between June and July this year, compared with a fall of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. The main upward contribution came from price movements in the games, toys and hobbies sector – notably computer games and consoles\n\n- **miscellaneous goods and services:** prices, overall, remained little changed between June and July this year, compared with a fall of 0.5% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward contribution came from a range of services – notably bank overdraft charges, where a number of banks removed or reduced some of their charges last year\n\nThe largest downward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between June and July 2015 came from:\n\n- **food and non-alcoholic beverages:** prices, overall, fell by 0.7% between June and July this year, compared with a smaller fall of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. The downward contribution came from price movements in most sectors – notably in the milk, cheese and eggs sector – where the prices of 2 pint cartons of shop bought milk have fallen. There was a partially offsetting contribution from rising prices in the bread and cereals sector\n\n- **fuels and lubricants:** average petrol prices rose by 0.1p and diesel prices fell by 2.5p between June and July this year to stand at 116.5p and 118.7p per litre respectively. This compares with a rise of 1.0p per litre on petrol and no change on diesel between the same 2 months in 2014\n\n- **restaurants and hotels:** prices, overall, rose by 0.1% between June and July this year, compared with a larger rise of 0.4% a year ago. The downward contribution came from price movements across the whole sector\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.

[Full details][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website and in an [explanatory note (313.9 Kb Pdf)][2] on our website. The improvements from the resulting development work were introduced as part of the February 2015 dataset with the historical series revised back to 2005. Further information on the changes is available in 2 articles: [Improvements to the measurement of Owner Occupiers’ Housing Costs and Private Housing Rental Prices (2.48 Mb Pdf)][3] and [Revising the weight of Owner Occupiers’ Housing in CPIH  (197.4 Kb Pdf)][4].**\n \nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n \nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n \nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n \nIn July 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between July 2014 and July 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.4%, up from 0.3% in June 2015.

It is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand this is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. Movements in price indices represent the changing cost of this basket. An [infographic][1] explains how consumer price inflation is calculated. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to August 2016, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between August 2015 and August 2016.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published. [A tale of many price indices][2] summarises information on the different measures.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/infographics/how-cpi-is-calculated/index.html\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/december-2012/sty-a-tale-of-many-price-indices.html","title":"A brief description of consumer price inflation"},{"markdown":"###What is the CPI?\n\nThe CPI is a measure of consumer price inflation produced to international standards and in line with European regulations. First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (2013)][1].\n\n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between August 2015 and August 2016 stood at 0.6%. This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in August 2015 would have cost £100.60 in August 2016.\n\nThe rate is unchanged from July and slightly above the figures experienced in the first half of 2016. The rates for 2016 to date are still relatively low overall but are generally above those experienced in 2015, which was a year of historically low inflation, with the rate being at or around zero for much of the year. The largest downward pull on inflation in August 2016 and for 2016 to date comes from prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages. Upward pressures come from a variety of categories, most notably restaurant and hotel bills. Transport prices provided a downward pressure during 2015 and early 2016 but this has eased during 2016 and they now have an upward effect. \n\n[Additional analysis of the Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI): August 2016][2] also published today, presents further analysis of the August PPI and CPI headline statistics and previous trends with a particular focus on how movements in the sterling exchange rate may have influenced these data.\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in August 2016 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"4c2e70e0\" />\n\nFigure B shows the CPI 12-month rate for the last 10 years. Table A shows the CPI 1-month rate (the amount prices change between 2 consecutive months), 12-month rate and index values for the last year.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"d53539d3\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"c5524524\" />\n\n###Consumer Prices Index (CPI): What are the main movements?\n\nThis section explains which goods and services had the biggest impact on the change to the 12-month rate between July and August 2016 and, where relevant, considers the longer-term inflationary trends for these goods and services.\n\nThe change in the CPI 12-month rate can be calculated by comparing the 12-month rates for 2 consecutive months. An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. [Explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (2013)][3] is a diagram explaining the calculation.\n\nThe CPI rose by 0.3% between July and August 2016, compared with a rise of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year earlier. The slight difference in the monthly movements was not sufficient to change the CPI 12-month rate due to rounding.\n\nBetween July and August 2016, the main upward contributions to change in the CPI 12-month rate came from the following groups.\n\nTransport: prices, overall, rose by 0.9% between July and August this year, compared with a rise of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. Within transport, the largest upward effect came from motor fuels, with prices falling between July and August 2016 but by less than between the same 2 months last year. The effect came particularly from diesel with prices falling by 1.2 pence per litre this year compared with a fall of 6.2 pence per litre a year ago. There was also a large upward contribution from air fares which rose between July and August by more than they did last year with the upward effect coming from European routes.\n\nFood and non-alcoholic beverages: the upward contribution came from food for which prices, overall, rose by 0.6% between July and August this year compared with a fall of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. The main upward effects came from a range of bread and cereal products and meat products. These reverse downward effects seen in these categories between June and July. The upward contributions were partially offset by a downward effect from mineral waters, soft drinks and juices with prices falling between July and August 2016, having risen between the same 2 months a year ago.\n\nThe main downward contributions to change in the CPI 12-month rate between July and August 2016 came from the following groups.\n\nRestaurants and hotels: prices, overall, fell by 0.4%, compared with a negligible change a year ago. The main downward contribution came from accommodation services, in particular overnight hotel accommodation, for which prices fell by more than a year ago. \n\nClothing and footwear: prices, overall, rose by 1.0% between July and August this year compared with a rise of 1.5% between the same 2 months a year ago. The downward effect came principally from garments, particularly children’s outerwear.\n\nAlcoholic beverages and tobacco: within this category, the downward contribution came from alcoholic beverages, for which prices rose overall by 0.3% between July and August 2016, compared with a larger rise of 2.4% between the same 2 months last year. The effect was primarily due to prices for wine, which rose by less than they did a year ago particularly for New World wine. The downward effect from alcohol was partially offset by a small upward contribution from tobacco where prices rose by more than a year ago.\n\nFurniture, household equipment and maintenance: the downward contribution came from furniture and furnishings with prices rising by less than a year ago across a range of furniture items.\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"c3c1f5f3\" />\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/additionalanalysisoftheproducerpriceindexppiandconsumerpriceindexcpi/aug2016\n  [3]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html","title":"Consumer Prices Index (CPI)"},{"markdown":"CPIH has been re-assessed to evaluate the extent to which it meets the professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics and the [assessment report][1] published on 3 March 2016. The report includes a number of requirements that need to be implemented for CPIH to regain its status as a National Statistic. The actions taken to address these requirements will be reported to the UK Statistics Authority later this month.\n\nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words, this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 16.5% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage, the basket of goods and services and the method of deriving the weights are the same as for the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. A full description of how CPIH is compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][2] and in various papers published on the [prices guidance and methodology webpage][3].\n\nIn August 2016, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between August 2015 and August 2016) for CPIH stood at 0.9%, unchanged from July 2016. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in August 2016 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as in July. Owner occupiers’ housing costs increased by 0.2% between July and August 2016, the same as the movement between these months a year earlier. This meant that they had a negligible impact on the change in the CPIH 12-month rate between the 2 months.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates for the last 10 years. The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The item indices behind the measurement of owner occupiers’ housing costs are included for the first time in the first quarter 2016 data. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. Previously the data published covered January 1996 to March 2016. The data for April to June 2016 are also now available. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the November CPI is published on 13 December 2016, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to September 2016.\n\nInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each member state of the European Union (EU) according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat will release figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of August 2016 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 15 September 2016. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables][7]. Further information on HICP for the EU, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][8]. \n\n####Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation\n\nThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\nThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2016 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2016 Basket of Goods and Services][9]. The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2016 are available in an article published on 22 March 2016 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2016 Weights][10]. \n\nRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from Tables 63 and 64 of the [Consumer Price Inflation dataset][11]. By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\nFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index, can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][12].

###News\n\n\t**Advisory Panels for Consumer Price Statistics**\n\n\tIn June 2015 the UK Statistics Authority announced the formation of 2 independent advisory panels on consumer price statistics: a technical panel to advise the National Statistician on technical aspects of the statistics; and a stakeholder panel to provide advice on the uses and applications of price indices. The announcement followed a review, led by Professor Sir Adrian Smith, which considered matters relating to the governance arrangements and structures underpinning the production of consumer price statistics.\n\n\tOn 27 November, the 2 panels met for the first time in a joint session. [Minutes and papers][1] were published on 14 December on our website. The panels will meet again on 22 January 2016.\n\n\t**Re-referencing of CPI and CPIH indices**\n\n\tFrom the release of January consumer price inflation data in February 2016, CPI and CPIH indices will be re-referenced and published with 2015=100. Regular re-referencing of indices is methodological good practice as it avoids rounding issues that can arise from small index values. Published CPI and CPIH inflation rates are calculated from unrounded indices, meaning that re-referencing will not impact on published inflation rates. Re-referencing will result in revisions to the CPI and CPIH indices. Full back series for each of the revised indices will be published shortly before publication of the January data. Re-referencing does not impact on RPI and RPIJ. Further details will be included in future CPI statistical bulletins. For more information please contact <cpi@ons.gsi.gov.uk>.\n\n\t**Correspondence with the Bank of England**\n\n\tSection 21 of the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 requires that, prior to making any change to the coverage or the basic calculation of the RPI, the UK Statistics Authority must consult the Bank of England as to whether any proposed change constitutes a fundamental change in the index which would be materially detrimental to the interests of the holders of relevant index-linked gilt edged securities. On 17 November 2015, ONS informed the Bank of England of the annual update to the basket of RPI items, and a review of the location boundaries wherein prices are collected. On 17 December 2015, the Bank concluded that these changes neither constituted a fundamental change in the index and nor was it likely to be materially detrimental to the holders of index-linked gilts.\n\n2. ###Understanding and accessing the data\n\n\tA full description of how consumer price indices are compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][2] (674.4 Kb Pdf). This is supplemented by infographics and textual information available from the [guidance and methodology][3] section of our website.\n\n\tA more detailed [quality report][4] (141.9 Kb Pdf) for this statistical bulletin is available. The report assesses consumer price inflation statistics against standard dimensions of quality such as relevance, accuracy and accessibility. The report was last updated in October 2013.\n\n\tThe mini [Triennial Review][5] (1.75 Mb Pdf) of the CPI and RPI Central Collection of Prices is available.\n\n\tThe most efficient way to access the latest consumer price inflation data and briefing on our website is via the CPI key figure on the homepage.\n\n\tIn response to user feedback, all consumer price inflation data are available in 1 location. The [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][6] are provided via an Excel file.\n\n\tTo help users further, very detailed CPI data are now available including the [individual price quotes and item indices][7] that underpin the CPI. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. The data published covers January 1996 to September 2015. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the February CPI is published on 22 March 2016, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to December 2015.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each member state of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of December 2015 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 19 January 2016. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables][8]. Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][9].\n\n3. ###Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation\n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services][10] (139.4 Kb Pdf). The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights][11] (431.9 Kb Pdf).\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][12]. By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][13] (674.4 Kb Pdf). [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics][14] (100.5 Kb Pdf) provides further details of how consumer price statistics are used more generally.\n\n4. ###Revisions policy\n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, a [revisions policy][15] (49.6 Kb Pdf) was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n5. ###Publication policy\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the December 2015 data, collected on and around 15 December 2015. Future [publication dates][16] for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2018 (the publication of the December 2017 inflation figures). Publication dates from February 2017 onwards are provisional.\n\n\tDetails of the policy governing the release of new data are available from our Media Relations Office. Also available is a list of the names of those given [pre-release access][17] to the contents of this release.\n\n\tIn line with the Consumer Price Inflation Pre-Release arrangements, an advanced estimate of the CPI was provided to the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer 4 working days ahead of publication. The Governor shared this information with the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and officials present at the MPC meeting, on Wednesday 13 January 2016.\n\n\tConsumer price inflation for January 2015 to January 2016 will be published on 16 February 2016.\n\n\tFollow us on [Twitter][18] or join us at [Facebook][19].\n\n\t**Media contact:**\n\n\tTel: Luke Croydon + 44 (0) 845 6041858</br>\n\tOut of hours media line + 44 (0) 7867 906553</br>\n\tEmail: <media.relations@ons.gsi.gov.uk>\n\n\t**Statistical contact:**\n\n\tTel: James Tucker +44 (0) 1633 456589</br>\n\tEmail: <cpi@ons.gsi.gov.uk>\n\n\tConsumer Price Inflation recorded message (available after 9.45am on release day):</br>\n\tTel: + 44 (0) 800 0113703 \n\n\tConsumer Price Inflation Enquiries:</br>\n\tTel: + 44 (0) 1633 456900\n\n6.

Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. An [infographic explains how consumer price inflation is calculated][1]. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to December 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between December 2014 and December 2015.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][1].\n\n### Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between December 2014 and December 2015 stood at 0.2%, a small increase compared with November 2015, when the rate was 0.1%. Although this is the first month since January 2015 for which the rate has exceeded 0.1%, this continues the trend since early 2015 of the rate being very close to zero. A rate of 0.2% means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in December 2014 would have cost £100.20 in December 2015.\n\nAs the rate has been very close to zero since early 2015, taken as a whole, households have experienced very little change in prices compared with the same months in 2014. Looking across the year overall, prices for transport costs, food and non-alcoholic beverages and (to a lesser extent) recreational and cultural goods and services have had a downward pull on the rate of inflation. These have been counterbalanced by an upward pull from price movements for other goods and services, most notably restaurant and hotel bills, and education costs such as university tuition fees.\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in December 2015 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.

An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. [Explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (37.1 Kb Pdf)][2] is a diagram explaining the calculation.\n\nThe CPI increased by 0.1% between November and December 2015, having been unchanged between the same 2 months a year earlier. The 1-month movement was therefore 0.1 percentage points higher this year compared with a year ago, leading to a rise in the CPI 12-month rate.\n\nBetween November and December 2015, the only substantial upward contribution to the change in the CPI 12-month rate came from:\n\n- transport: prices, overall, increased by 1.8% between November and December this year, compared with a fall of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward effect on the change in the 12-month rate came principally from air fares and to a lesser extent motor fuels. Air fares increased by 46% between November and December 2015 compared with 19% between the same 2 months a year earlier. This is the largest November to December price increase since 2002, although it is important to note that air fare prices are highly variable. November to December rises in excess of 40% were also seen in 2009 to 2011. Motor fuel prices fell by less than they did a year ago, meaning that they had an upward contribution to the change in the 12-month rate. Petrol prices fell by 3.4 pence per litre this year compared with a larger fall of 6.1 pence a year ago, while diesel fell by 2.3 pence this year compared with 4.8 pence a year ago\n\nThe largest downward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between November and December 2015 came from:\n\n- food and non-alcoholic beverages: prices, overall, fell by 0.2% between November and December this year, compared with a rise of 0.3% between the same 2 months a year ago. Price changes for cauliflower and potato crisps had the largest downward contribution to the change in the 12-month rate\n\n- alcoholic beverages and tobacco: prices, overall, fell by 1.3%, compared with a smaller fall of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year earlier. Wine and spirits were the main contributors to the change in the 12-month rate, with both showing larger price drops than in the same period a year ago\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.

CPIH was first assessed in 2013. In August 2014 its National Statistics status was removed pending work to improve the methods for measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs in the index. [Full details][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website and in an [explanatory note][2] (313.9 Kb Pdf) on our website. The improvements from the resulting development work were introduced as part of the February 2015 dataset with the historical series revised back to 2005. Further information on the changes is available in 2 articles: [Improvements to the measurement of Owner Occupiers’ Housing Cost and Private Housing Rental Prices][3] (2.48 Mb Pdf) and [Revising the weight of Owner Occupiers’ Housing in CPIH][4] (197.4 Kb Pdf) .\n\nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn December 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between December 2014 and December 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.5%, up from 0.4% in November 2015. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in December 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in November 2015.\n\nOwners occupiers' housing costs increased by 0.2% between November and December 2015, the same as between these months a year earlier. This means that it had a very small impact on the change on the CPIH 12 month rate between the two months.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the official CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"f2b53064\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"c6ceb1b6\" />\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/consumer-price-indices-including-housing-costs-cpih-indicator/ \"Consumer Price Indices including Housing Costs (CPIH) Indicator\"\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpih-announcement-august-2014.pdf \"CPIH announcement August 2014\"\n  [3]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/improvements-to-the-measurement-of-owner-occupiers--housing.pdf \"Improvements to the measurement of owner occupiers’ housing costs and private housing rental prices\"\n  [4]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/revising-the-weight-of-owner-occupiers--housing-in-cpih.pdf \"Revising the weight of Owner Occupiers' Housing in CPIH\"","title":"CPIH"},{"markdown":"In accordance with the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, the Retail Prices Index and its derivatives have been assessed against the Code of Practice for Official Statistics and found not to meet the required standard for designation as National Statistics. The [full assessment report][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.\n\nThe RPI is a long-standing measure of UK inflation that has historically been used for a wide range of purposes such as the indexation of pensions, rents and index-linked gilts. For further information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics][2] (100.5 Kb Pdf).\n\nRPIJ is an improved variant of the Retail Prices Index, which is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn December 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.5%, up from 0.3% in the year to November 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for December 2015 stood at 1.2%, meaning that it was 0.7 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 34.3% over the 10-year period, compared with 27.2% as measured by RPIJ. The use of the Carli formula has therefore added 7.1 percentage points to the change in prices over the last 10 years.\n\nTable C shows the RPI and RPIJ 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"be0b2fce\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"c19bcfee\" />\n\nFor users who want to understand the causes of the difference between the CPI and RPI, please see Table 5 in the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][3].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/the-retail-prices-index/ \"The Retail Price Index\"\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/users-and-uses-of-the-consumer-price-inflation-statistics.pdf \"Users and uses of the consumer price inflation statistics\"\n  [3]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-323669 \"Consumer Price Inflation, December 2015 Reference Tables\"","title":"Retail Prices Index (RPI) and RPIJ"},{"markdown":"Table D outlines where data for all consumer price inflation statistics can be found.\n\n<ons-table path=\"d7708dd3\" />","title":"Guide to data"}],"unit":null,"versions":[],"headline1":null,"entities":{"organizations":["UK Statistics Authority","RPI","HTML","Housing","CPIH \"","CPIH","Consumer","UK","National Statistics","Private","Housing Costs","CPI","National Statistic","Housing Rental Prices"],"dates":["December 2015","December 2014","a year ago","2011","last year","2009","1997","2007","December","2005","earlier","November 2015","this year","a year","February 2015","January 2006","November","a year earlier","December 2014 and December 2015","between December 2014 and December 2015","November to","since early 2015","since 2002","August","7708","August 2014","2015","2014","2013","last 10 years","since","since January 2015"]},"headline2":null,"headline3":null,"relatedData":[{"uri":"/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceinflation"},{"uri":"/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceindices"}],"relatedMethodology":[{"uri":"/economy/inflationandpriceindices/qmis/consumerpriceinflationqmi"}],"preUnit":null},"matched_queries":["logged_featureset"]},{"fields":{"_ltrlog":[{"log_entry":[{"name":"1","value":0.0},{"name":"2","value":3.4069672},{"name":"3","value":3.982428}]}]},"_index":"bulletin","_type":"document","_id":"AWAmeL4Akn1BPMj_zqvR","_score":0.0,"_source":{"description":{"summary":"Change in the prices of goods and services bought by UK households, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Price Index (RPI) and their variants CPIH and RPIJ.","nextRelease":"22 March 2016","keywords":["economy","weights","index","indices","retail"],"releaseDate":"2016-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","edition":"January 2016","source":"","title":"Consumer Price Inflation","metaDescription":"Change in the prices of goods and services bought by UK households, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Retail Price Index (RPI) and their variants CPIH and RPIJ.","nationalStatistic":true,"unit":"","headline1":"The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rose by 0.3% in the year to January 2016, compared with a 0.2% rise in the year to December 2015","headline2":"This is the third consecutive month of small increases, with the rate in January 2016 being the same as it was in January 2015","contact":{"name":"James Tucker","telephone":"+44 (0)1633 456900","email":"cpi@ons.gsi.gov.uk"},"headline3":"The main contributors to the rise in the rate were motor fuels, and to a lesser extent food, alcoholic beverages and clothing","preUnit":""},"edition":null,"source":null,"type":"bulletin","metaDescription":null,"contact":null,"relatedDocuments":[],"links":[],"accordion":[{"markdown":"1. #### News \n\n\t#### Re-referencing of CPI and CPIH indices \n\n\tFrom this month, CPI and CPIH indices have been re-referenced and published with 2015=100. Regular re-referencing of indices is methodological good practice as it avoids rounding issues that can arise from small index values. Please note that re-referencing does not impact on published inflation rates, although when using the indices to calculate inflation rates, it is important to use indices that are calculated in the same reference year. Re-referencing does not impact on RPI and RPIJ. An article explains the [rationale for re-referencing (24.3 Kb Pdf)][1] in more detail. For more information, please contact <cpi@ons.gsi.gov.uk>.\n\n\t#### ONS Economic Forum – Measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs in CPIH \n\n\tThis event will be held at the Bank of England on 26 February 2016, and will give users an opportunity to hear about the development of the owner occupiers’ housing component of CPIH. [Further details][2] are available on our website.\n\n\t#### Consumer Price Inflation Weights \n\n\tIn line with usual practice, the January 2016 indices include the planned updates to the higher level CPI and CPIH weights. The February 2016 indices will include the planned updates to the higher level RPIJ and RPI weights, and to the CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI item weights. Details of the weights change will be published in an article on 22 March 2016.\n\n\t#### Update to the Consumer Price Inflation Basket of Goods and Services \n\n\tThe goods and services that are priced to construct the consumer price inflation indices (CPI, CPIH, RPIJ & RPI) are reviewed annually to ensure that the indices reflect the latest spending patterns by customers in the UK. Changes to the basket of goods and services this year, effective from the February indices, will be described in an article to be published by ONS on 15 March 2016.\n\n2. #### Understanding and accessing the data \n\n\tA full description of how consumer price indices are compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)][3]. This is supplemented by infographics and textual information available from the [guidance and methodology section][4] of our website.\n\n\tA more detailed [quality report (141.9 Kb Pdf)][5] for this statistical bulletin is available. The report assesses consumer price inflation statistics against standard dimensions of quality such as relevance, accuracy and accessibility. The report was last updated in October 2013.\n\n\tThe [mini Triennial Review (1.75 Mb Pdf)][6] of the CPI and RPI Central Collection of Prices is available.\n\n\tThe most efficient way to access the latest consumer price inflation data and briefing on our website is via the [CPI key figure on the homepage][7].\n\n\tIn response to user feedback, all consumer price inflation data are available in 1 location. The [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][8] are provided via an Excel file.\n\n\tTo help users further, very detailed CPI data are now available including the [individual price quotes and item indices][9] that underpin the CPI. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. The data published covers January 1996 to September 2015. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the February CPI is published on 22 March 2016, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to December 2015.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each member state of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of January 2016 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 25 February 2016. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables][10]. Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][11].\n\n3. #### Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation \n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services (139.4 Kb Pdf)][12]. The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights (431.9 Kb Pdf)][13].\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 63 and 64 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][14]. By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)][15]. [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][16] provides further details of how consumer price statistics are used more generally.\n\n4. #### Revisions policy \n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, a [revisions policy (49.6 Kb Pdf)][17] was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n5. #### Publication policy \n\n\tThis bulletin includes the January 2016 data, collected on and around 12 January 2016.

Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. An [infographic explains how consumer price inflation is calculated][1]. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to January 2016, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between January 2015 and January 2016.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][1].\n\n### Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between January 2015 and January 2016 stood at 0.3%, a small increase compared with December 2015, when the rate was 0.2%. A rate of 0.3% means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in January 2015 would have cost £100.30 in January 2016.\n\nThe last year, 2015, was a year of very low inflation, with the rate being at or close to zero for most of the year. Looking across 2015 overall, prices for transport costs, food and non-alcoholic beverages and (to a lesser extent) recreational and cultural goods and services had a downward pull on the rate of inflation. These were counterbalanced by an upward pull from price movements for other goods and services, most notably restaurant and hotel bills, and education costs such as university tuition fees. The rate has seen small increases for 3 consecutive months beginning in November 2015, although it remains low in the historic context.\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in January 2016 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.

An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. [Explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (37.1 Kb Pdf)][2] is a diagram explaining the calculation.\n\nThe CPI decreased by 0.8% between December 2015 and January 2016, compared with a decrease of 0.9% between the same 2 months a year earlier. The 1-month movement was therefore 0.1 percentage points higher this year compared with a year ago, leading to a rise in the CPI 12-month rate.\n\nBetween December 2015 and January 2016, the main upward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate came from:\n\n- motor fuels and lubricants: overall, prices decreased by 2.6%, compared with a larger fall of 6.8% a year ago. The largest upward contribution to the change in the 12-month rate came from prices for petrol, which dropped by 1.9%, compared with a larger fall of 7.3% between the same 2 months a year ago. A similar, though less pronounced, effect was seen for diesel, with prices falling by 4.0%, compared with a fall of 6.0% a year ago\n\n- food and non-alcoholic beverages: the upward contribution came from food prices which, overall, fell by 0.6% between December 2015 and January 2016, compared with a larger fall of 1.0% between the same 2 months a year ago. The overall upward contribution was due to smaller upward pressures for a variety of products. Notably, prices for shop-bought milk saw a small decrease in price, whereas last year prices fell at a number of major supermarket chains, resulting in a larger decrease\n\n- alcoholic beverages and tobacco: the upward contribution came from prices for alcoholic beverages which, overall, increased by 5.2% between December 2015 and January 2016, compared with an increase of 3.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. Beer and spirits were the main contributors to the rise. Prices for beer increased between December 2015 and January 2016, which is a return to the more usual pattern of price rises into the new year, following a fall in January last year\n\n- clothing and footwear: the upward contribution came mainly from prices for clothing which, overall, decreased by 3.4%, compared with a larger fall of 3.9% between the same 2 months a year ago. The overall upward contribution resulted from smaller upward pressures for a variety of items of clothing\n\nThe only substantial downward contribution to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between December 2015 and January 2016 came from:\n\n- air fares: prices, overall, fell by 35.8% compared with a smaller fall of 17.1% a year ago. The downward contribution to the change in the 12-month rate was greater than the upward contribution from motor fuels, which has resulted in a downward contribution from transport overall. It is important to note that air fare prices are highly variable. They typically drop in January following increases in December, with the increase in December 2015 being the largest December rise since 2002\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.

The improvements from the resulting development work were introduced as part of the February 2015 dataset with the historical series revised back to 2005. Further information on the changes is available in 2 articles: [Improvements to the measurement of Owner Occupiers’ Housing Cost and Private Housing Rental Prices (2.48 Mb Pdf)][3] and [Revising the weight of Owner Occupiers’ Housing in CPIH (197.4 Kb Pdf)][4].\n\nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 16.5% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn January 2016, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between January 2015 and January 2016) for CPIH stood at 0.6%, up from 0.5% in December 2015. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in January 2016 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in December 2015.\n\nOwners occupiers’ housing costs increased by 0.3% between December 2015 and January 2016, compared with 0.2% between these months a year earlier. This means that they had a small impact on the change on the CPIH 12-month rate between the 2 months.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the official CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The [full assessment report][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.\n\nThe RPI is a long-standing measure of UK inflation that has historically been used for a wide range of purposes such as the indexation of pensions, rents and index-linked gilts. For further information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][2].\n\nRPIJ is an improved variant of the Retail Prices Index, which is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn January 2016, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.7%, up from 0.5% in the year to December 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for January 2016 stood at 1.3%, meaning that it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years.
