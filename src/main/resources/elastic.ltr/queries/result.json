In such an analysis, GDHI is calculated as the sum of the primary account and the secondary account of the household and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) economic sector. In turn, both of these accounts are made up of resources (incomings) and uses (outgoings). \n\nThe primary account is mostly made up of resources into the household sector including wages and salaries, income from self-employment, income from the ownership of financial assets and also net rental income from buildings.\n\nThe secondary account reflects some of the elements that re-distribute primary income. It includes incomings such as social benefits received and other current transfers such as monetary gifts balanced against outgoings such as direct taxes (for example, income tax) and social contributions (for example, national insurance contributions).\n\nFigure 2 shows the LEPs with the highest and lowest level of primary income per head, alongside each LEPs level of GDHI per head. The difference between the two values reflects the impact of the secondary account, which includes (direct) taxes and social benefits.  It should be noted that (by definition) the calculation of GDHI does not include any impact of indirect taxes or of benefits in kind (for example, from consumption of state provision of education or health services). They also do not account for differences in the cost of living between different areas.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"cc81b8ab\" />\n\nFigure 2 shows that the impact of the taxes (direct) and benefits included within the secondary account is a reduction in size of the household income gap per person between the richest and poorest areas. Therefore, while the average primary income per head in London in 2014 was more than double (107%) that of the LEP with the lowest level of primary income (Black Country), the gap between the LEP with the highest GDHI (Buckinghamshire Thames Valley) and lowest GDHI (Black Country) was lower at 73%.\n\nExamining just the resources (incomings) flowing into the household and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) sector,  Figure 3 shows the LEPs with the highest and lowest proportions of primary resources as a percentage of total resources (primary plus secondary) in 2014, with the England average shown for comparison.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"71abcbd7\" />\n\nAs would be expected, the areas with high GDHI per head also tend to have the higher shares of total incomings from primary income sources. London LEP had the largest proportion at 84.9%, followed by Thames Valley Berkshire LEP at 82.3%. By contrast, for some LEPs, only around 70% of incoming resources where from primary sources as opposed to secondary sources. Liverpool City Region LEP had the smallest share of primary resources as a proportion of total household incomings in 2014, at 70.6%.

For data on economic output by LEPs, ONS has published LEP data for GVA and labour productivity.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure1_tcm77-415922.png","title":"GDHI per head"},{"markdown":"The components of gross disposable household income (GDHI) trace the resources (incomings) and uses (outgoings) of the household and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) economic sector. This component analysis will look at the different incomings to this sector.\n\n###Household and NPISH sector resources\n\nResources, or incomings, of the household and NPISH sector can be split into primary resources and secondary resources. The former relates to items such as wages and salaries, rental income and interest on savings. The latter relates to social benefits received and other current transfers, such as monetary gifts and insurance payouts.\n\n###Primary resources\n\nPrimary resources comprise operating surplus, mixed income, compensation of employees and property income and relate to the income earned by the household and NPISH sector as a result of productive activity or the ownership of productive assets. They include wages and salaries, rental income from buildings, income from self-employment and income from the ownership of financial assets, such as interest on savings.\n\nAnalysis of the components of GDHI over time shows that between 2007 and 2012, the amount of primary resources earned as a proportion of total household incomings fell for all LEPs. This is likely to be as a result of the economic downturn which hit the UK in 2008. For the majority of LEPs, primary resources as a proportion of total household incomings increased between 2012 and 2013.\n\nFigure 2 shows the 10 LEPs with the highest and lowest proportions of primary resources as a percentage of household incomings in 2013, with the England average shown for comparison.<ons-chart path=\"/economy/regionalaccounts/grossdisposablehouseholdincome/articles/regionaleconomicanalysis/2015-09-10/1d5377de\" />\n\nCornwall and the Isles of Scilly LEP had the smallest share of primary resources as a proportion of total household incomings in 2013, at 70.4%. This was followed by Tees Valley LEP at 70.6%. London LEP had the largest proportion at 83.9%, followed by Thames Valley Berkshire LEP at 81.2%.\n\nThe following section looks at the other incomes earned by the household sector, which are described as ‘secondary resources’.\n\n###Social benefits and imputed social contributions\n\nSocial benefits and imputed social contributions are the main source of secondary resources, the amount received by the household sector in the redistribution of income. They include national insurance fund benefits, such as state pensions and unemployment allowance, and non-contributory benefits such as Child Benefit and tax credits. Imputed social contributions are those paid directly by employers to current and former employees without involving an insurance enterprise or autonomous pension fund, and without creating a special fund or segregated reserve for the purpose; the imputed contributions are equal in value to the amount of social contributions that would be needed to secure the de facto entitlements to the social benefits they accumulate.\n\nFigure 3 shows the 10 LEPs where social benefits as a percentage of total household incomings was highest and the 10 LEPs where this proportion was lowest, for 2013, with the England average shown for comparison.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/economy/regionalaccounts/grossdisposablehouseholdincome/articles/regionaleconomicanalysis/2015-09-10/3d758740\" />\n\nThe same set of LEPs appears in Figure 3 as appeared in Figure 2 showing the proportion of primary resources to total resources. The LEPs with the lowest proportion of social benefits to total resources are once again mainly located in the South or East of England, with London LEP the lowest at 13.3%. The LEPs with the highest proportion of social benefits to total resources are more geographically spread out across England, with Liverpool City Region LEP the highest at 25.0%.\n\nFor all of the LEPs the proportion of social benefits to total resources was higher in 2012 and 2013 compared to 2007, prior to the economic downturn. \n","title":"Analysis of the key components of GDHI"}],"_abstract":null,"latestRelease":false,"unit":null,"dateChanges":null,"versions":null,"relatedArticles":[],"entities":{"persons":["Household"],"organizations":["NUTS","GVA","Local Enterprise Partnership","ONS","UK","Local Enterprise Partnerships","National Statistics","6858","GDHI"],"dates":["from 2008 to 2013","5377","2012","2011","last year","7151","2008","1997","2007","2003","2013","2012 to 2013","2011 to 2012","6858","last 10 years"],"locations":["Social","Greater Manchester","Greater Manchester LEPs","England","London"]},"relatedData":[{"uri":"/economy/regionalaccounts/grossdisposablehouseholdincome/datasets/localenterprisepartnershipslepsgdhi"}],"relatedMethodology":[{"uri":"/economy/regionalaccounts/grossdisposablehouseholdincome/qmis/regionalgrossdisposablehouseholdincomeqmi"}],"preUnit":null},"matched_queries":["logged_featureset"]},{"fields":{"_ltrlog":[{"log_entry":[{"name":"1","value":0.0},{"name":"2","value":0.611524}]}]},"_index":"article","_type":"document","_id":"AWA1nWfN90MS5JzXGf3U","_score":0.0,"_source":{"description":{"nextRelease":"","keywords":["regions","household sector","GDHI","saving"],"releaseDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","edition":"2016","source":"","title":"The feasibility of producing regional household final consumption expenditure, UK","metaDescription":"A summary of research conducted so far into the feasibility of producing regional household final consumption expenditure and recommendations for further work.","nationalStatistic":false,"_abstract":"Household final consumption expenditure (HFCE) generally covers traditional consumer spending on goods and services to meet their day to day needs.

The total HFCE for the UK for 2015 was £1,157,989 million^1^.  Being able to measure this type of expenditure regionally is becoming increasingly important due to devolution of power to regions and local areas. To meet the growing need for better regional statistics, we conducted this study to determine whether it is possible to produce regional HFCE at this point in time. \n\nThis report summarises work carried out so far in order to produce regional HFCE at a Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS)1, 2 and 3 levels. It considers how HFCE is compiled and published at a national level, and provides definitions of key concepts and terminology, such as final consumption expenditure, classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP) categories used to classify the aforementioned, and households.\n\nIt also discusses the national and domestic concept of HFCE; the domestic concept measures all the expenditure in the UK by UK residents and non-residents. The national concept measures expenditure by UK households in the UK and abroad, and excludes any expenditure by non-residents. These two concepts will have a great bearing on what can be published as not all data sources collect their information according to the same set of principles, such as Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) which collects expenditure data from the UK household’s perspective, and thus their location; essentially national concept HFCE. Whereas the Retail Sales Inquiry (RSI) collects turnover data from the business perspective, and thus is domestic concept HFCE as it includes all spending by UK households and non-UK residents.\n\nThis takes us to another important aspect of national HFCE, many different sources of data feed into national HFCE such as our surveys (mainly LCF, RSI and the Annual Business Survey), administrative data from HMRC, data from other government departments, market research, sector regulators and businesses. These sources are adjusted, grossed, smoothed and have historic ratios or linked factors applied to them during compilation. Some data is also forecast. Further investigation is needed to understand these methods and the impact they could have on regional indicator datasets used to apportion national totals, and thus the quality of regional HFCE.\nLCF, a major data source, is likely to be available at NUTS3, however further research is needed into all other sources to confirm their regional availability. The biggest contributor to national HFCE is owner occupied imputed rental, and we are currently working on improving its compilation method so will have a good quality regional indicator for this.\n\nThe study has concluded that regional HFCE is theoretically possible. However further investigation into data sources is needed before concluding for certain that it can be compiled in practice, and that the outputs would be of acceptable quality. Below is a full list of recommendations as a result of this report:\n\n###Recommendations:\n\n1. Better understanding of the many adjustments and calculations used to compile UK HFCE is needed to determine which need to be carried out at a regional level.\n\n2. As the LCF doesn’t collect information on institutions such as prisons, residential care homes nor halls, further investigations are needed to discover exactly how HFCE gross up the LCF to account for this.\n\n3. Further investigation into whether International Passenger Survey (IPS) data can be apportioned regionally, where used to supplement Labour Force Survey (LFS) data to produce domestic concept HFCE. \n\n4. Ensure regional HFCE is considered as part of wider project to improve owner occupied imputed rental.\n\n5. Obtain clarification on which Scottish islands are considered offshore for the purpose of the LCF, and map these to NUTS3 areas to determine which areas are affected by being excluded from the LCF sample.\n\n6. Determine a suitable method for the Isles of Scilly where LCF data is used; the Isles are not sampled.\n\n7. Gain better understanding of LCF Northern Ireland sample size and number of responding households. Also enquire about the probable date of the future sample boost for Northern Ireland. \n\n8. Ensure open communication is maintained with Scottish government as to project progress. \n\n9. Regional Accounts to be involved in renegotiation of any commercial contracts relating to access to data used in HFCE.\n\n10. Detailed investigation of data available for regional imports and exports. \n\n11. Investigation into the impact of cross border domestic tourism.\n\n12. System used for compilation of regional HFCE is set up to process and output domestic concept, net tourism, and national concept HFCE as separate series for each region.\n\n####Notes on Executive summary:\n\n1. Based on the national concept, see the [United Kingdom National Accounts, The Blue Book: 2015 Edition][1] for further information.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/compendium/unitedkingdomnationalaccountsthebluebook/2015-10-30","title":"Executive summary"},{"markdown":"###a) Background\n\n####Regional economic statistics\n\nRegional economic statistics have existed for many years, however their availability in terms of topic and regional coverage have varied over time. Ever since the [Allsopp Review][1] in 2004 concluded that there was a “pressing need for better regional data” we have been working on improving the range, detail and quality of regional economic data. The [Bean Review][2] in 2016 expanded on this, by stating that users need \"timelier and more detailed statistics at a finer level of geographical disaggregation\". \n\nThe increased pace of devolution of powers, not only to the nations, such as Scotland and Wales, but at a lower regional or local level with City Deals and Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs), is also driving the need for better regional data. In order to achieve their goals of improving economic growth these organisations will need to access data about their particular area, and as the Bean Review states “the lack of information […] represents a handicap for policy and business decisions”.\n\n####Household final consumption expenditure statistics\n\nThere are four main drivers for Household final consumption expenditure statistics (HFCE):\n\n1. Decision making – at present we publish regional gross disposable household income (GDHI), which shows the amount households have left over for spending or saving after the effect of taxes and benefits on household labour and investment income have been accounted for. GDHI is thus a “valuable measure of relative wealth between regions”^1^ but provides no information on how that leftover amount is actually spent or saved. HFCE is the next step in the household account and would provide users with information on the spending patterns of households, and hence a more complete picture of the demand for goods and services across different regions. This information would help inform policy decisions and investment decisions for areas with devolved powers. It could also guide private business investment decisions^2^. \n\n2. Savings ratio – having calculated regional household final consumption expenditure (HFCE), we should be able to derive the savings ratio on a regional basis. The savings ratio is a valuable headline indicator as it is the percentage of disposable income leftover after spending.\n\n3. Longer term goals – regional data on consumer spending could also help in the longer-term development of our regional Supply and Use Tables (SUT). The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) has expressed a desire for these data to inform their own SUT and for wider policy use. \n\n4. [European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA)][3] – Under ESA the transmission of regional HFCE is a voluntary requirement (see section below for further detail). The UK, as one of the larger EU economies, should aim to be fully compliant with the ESA requirements.\n\n###b) Objectives of report\n\nThe objectives of this report are to assess the feasibility of producing regional HFCE; this will include investigating whether regional HFCE is possible at Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS)1, NUTS2 and NUTS3 level, and the product breakdown for each region. Implicit to this will be a high level investigation into the main sources of data that feed into HFCE data as published in Blue Book, as our intention is to be as inline as possible with the data that’s published in Blue Book in terms of numbers and product breakdown.\n\nOur minimum aim is to produce regional HFCE that satisfies the requirements of Table 13 of the European System of Accounts 2010 Transmission Programme of Data (TPD,) that is at NUTS level 2, and is in line with the product breakdown in Blue Book. Further detail of product breakdown can be found in section d) Measuring HFCE, below.\n\nOur ideal goal would be to produce the same breakdown as Blue Book at NUTS3. Therefore to avoid duplication of effort, a baseline of investigating source data at NUTS3 has been established. If it is found that data is available at NUTS3 and of sufficient quality, then a bottom-up approach would be utilised whereby NUTS3 data would be aggregated to NUTS2, and NUTS2 data to NUTS1.\n\nIn line with our policy and Bean Review guidance, we will investigate administrative data and big data sources as well as existing survey data. The characteristics of these sources will determine the quality of the regional HFCE output. Factors such as the following will all need to be considered:\n\n- timeliness of the data\n\n- time period covered\n\n- sample size of survey data\n\n- regional coverage\n\n- level of detail available\n\n- methods of collection of the data (web scraping, surveys, mandatory returns to industry regulators, administrative data)\n\n- measurement method (that is, is the data collected from the household itself or from a business’ perspective) along with definitions of variables\n\n- missingness and quality of data (in terms of errors and data cleaning)\n\nAll investigations are based on producing the above breakdown in current prices.\n\nIf regional HFCE is deemed feasible, we aim to deliver our first output in the Spring of 2018 as experimental statistics.\n\nRecommendations are noted throughout this report in relation to areas that require further investigation before a new system can be built to produce HFCE.\n\n###c) Defining HFCE – Concepts and terminology\n\nHFCE is recorded in the Use of Income Account in the national accounts. It is recorded as a use, with disposable household income recorded as a resource in the same account. The balancing item of the account is saving.\n\nESA2010 states that there are two concepts of final consumption:\n\n1. Final consumption expenditure (P.3)\n\n2. Actual final consumption (P.4)\n\nIt states that “Final consumption expenditure is expenditure on goods and services used by households, NPISHs [Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households] and government to satisfy individual and collective needs. In contrast, actual final consumption refers to its acquisition of consumption goods and services”^3^.\n \nIndividual consumption expenditure is classified according to the internationally agreed system of classification for reporting consumption expenditure in national accounts; classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP)^4^. \n\nThere are 14 categories in the classification:\n\n01 - food and non-alcoholic beverages<br>\n02 - alcoholic beverages, tobacco and narcotics<br>\n03 - clothing and footwear<br>\n04 - housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels<br>\n05 - furnishings, household equipment and routine household maintenance<br>\n06 - health<br>\n07 - transport<br>\n08 - communication<br>\n09 - recreation and culture<br>\n10 - education<br>\n11 - restaurants and hotels<br>\n12 - miscellaneous goods and services<br>\n13 - individual consumption expenditure of non-profit institutions serving households<br>\n14 - individual consumption expenditure of general government\n\nThe sum of the first 12 categories in this system give individual consumption expenditure of households, and the last two give individual consumption expenditure by the non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) and general government sectors. Together all 14 categories represent actual final consumption by households^5^, that is, what the household sector actually consumes as opposed to what they purchase.\n\nFor regional HFCE we are therefore interested in the first 12 categories only. These are the normal, day to day expenditures of households on goods and services, such as food and drink, utilities, clothing and visits to the dentist. Owner-occupied imputed rental is also included for the purpose of national accounts and will be discussed later in this article.\n\nHouseholds, as a sector in the national accounts are individuals or groups of people sharing living accommodation and possibly other aspects of daily life such as meals. The household sector thus includes not only those living in traditional households, but also those people living in institutions, such as retirement homes, boarding houses or prisons^6^. \n\nHFCE predominantly covers traditional consumer spending on goods and services, including housing services, to meet their requirements for day-to-day living^7^. \n\nHFCE also includes the following:\n\n- goods and services received as income in kind by employees, such as free or subsidised meals and accommodation\n\n- goods or services produced as outputs of unincorporated enterprises owned by households that are retained for consumption by members of the household; examples are food and agricultural produce\n\n- domestic service (for example, cleaners and gardeners)\n\n- imputed rentals for owner-occupied dwellings\n\nHFCE excludes the following:\n\n- items treated as intermediate consumption , for example, expenditure that an owner occupier incurs on the decoration, maintenance and repair of the dwelling not typically carried out by tenants\n\n- expenditure by households owning unincorporated enterprises when incurred for business purposes, for example, fuel for the business vehicle\n\n- items treated as gross fixed capital formation, for example, purchase of dwellings or major improvements to existing dwellings, stamp duty in relation to transfer of land or property (but stamp duty in relation to transfer of bonds and shares is included under COICOP 12.6.2.)\n\n- items treated as gross capital formation , that is valuables such as antiques, works of art or jewellery when purchased as stores of value\n\n- subscriptions, contributions and dues paid by households to NPISH, such as trade unions and sports clubs\n\n- voluntary transfers in cash or in kind by households to charities, relief and aid organisations\n\n- any business expenditure where the household owns an unincorporated enterprise\n\nHaving defined what HFCE includes and excludes, it is also important to recognise that it can be measured by two different concepts; the domestic concept and national concept. The domestic concept measures all the expenditure in the UK by UK residents and non-residents. The national concept measures expenditure by UK households in the UK and abroad. The national concept does not include any expenditure by non-residents in the UK. To achieve the national concept, expenditure by UK residents abroad (imports) is added to the domestic concept, and expenditure by non-residents in the UK (exports) is subtracted; domestic concept HFCE plus net tourism equals national concept HFCE.\n\n####Currently published data\n\nWe publish the [UK National Accounts known as the Blue Book][4]. The data published in the Blue Book satisfy the requirements of Table 1 and Table 5 of the TPD in relation to HFCE. The relevant tables in the Blue Book for 2016 are 6.2 and 6.3. Table 6.2 provides current price data and 6.3 provides chain volume measures. The tables organize the data into durable goods, semi-durable goods, non-durable goods and services^8^ and their respective COICOP categories^9^. These four sections are summed to produce final consumption expenditure in the UK by resident and non-resident households (domestic concept). The table also provides final consumption expenditure outside the UK by UK resident households, final consumption expenditure in the UK by households resident in rest of the world and final consumption expenditure by UK resident households in the UK and abroad (national concept). \n\nThe value of UK HFCE at current prices for 2015 is £1,147,262 million based on the domestic concept, and £1,157,989 million on the national concept (see below for further information on domestic and national). \n\nNo data is currently published which satisfies the requirements of Table 13. \n\n###d) Measuring HFCE\n\nBlue Book publishes UK data under the following headings:\n\n- durable goods; COICOP categories 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 12, total.\n\n- semi-durable goods; COICOP categories 03, 05, 07, 09, 12, total.\n\n- non-durable goods; COICOP categories 01, 02, 04, 05, 06, 07, 09, 12, total.\n\n- services; COICOP categories 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, total.\n\n- final consumption expenditure in the UK by resident and non-resident households (domestic concept) that is, the sum of the four above.\n\n- final consumption expenditure outside the UK by UK resident households (imports).\n\n- final consumption expenditure in the UK by households resident in rest of the world (exports).\n\n- final consumption expenditure by UK resident households in the UK and abroad (national concept). \n\n####How it’s done at UK level\n\nUK level data is processed at the 4-digit COICOP level. Sources of data include surveys, administrative and market research, other government departments, sector regulators and businesses. Various adjustments (coherence, data validation, multiplicative, balancing and explicit exhaustiveness adjustments to name a few) are made to the data, along with other calculations such as grossing, smoothing, applying historic ratios or link factors. For example, Annual Business survey (ABS) data is apportioned using a Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) ratio, and then a multiplicative Retail Sales Inquiry (RSI) adjustment is applied (applies to COICOP 05.1.1 to 05.1.5 excluding 05.1.3). Some data are also forecast (using ARIMA, or Holt Winters) as data sources have dried up.\n\nLink factors are used to address the step change in LCF data series. Prior to Quarter 2  (Apr to June) 2001 we conducted two household budget surveys; the Family Expenditure survey and the National Food Survey. In Quarter 2 2001 these were merged to form the Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS), the LCF’s predecessor. Changes to methodology and sample size were made at the same time hence the need to link the old datasets to the EFS. The EFS underwent a name change to the LCF in 2008; no methodological changes were implemented thus no link factors are used during 2008.\n\nThe ABS collects financial data from businesses’ end year accounts, such as total turnover. A breakdown of retail and non-retail turnover is requested, and in the retail section a further breakdown by product is requested. This breakdown is used for some of the COICOP categories as described in Table 1 below.\n\nWhere the LCF is used, some categories are supplemented by International Passenger Survey (IPS) data to ensure expenditure by UK non-residents is included as the LCF only covers UK resident households.\n\nDeductions are made for some categories such as in COICOP 04.5.1 electricity, for the use of electricity in the production of cannabis, which is considered intermediate consumption. Deductions are also made to COICOPs 03 clothing and footwear, 04.1.1 actual rentals paid by tenants for housing and 06.1.1 private purchases of medication, in relation to intermediate consumption with regard to prostitution. \n\nFour-digit data is fed to the supply use system and aggregated to classification of product activity (CPA) categories and balanced. The balancing adjustment is provided to HFCE who decide how to distribute the adjustment across the 4-digit COICOP categories within that CPA category, depending on the quality of data sources at the 4-digit level. \n\nData is then aggregated up to 2-digit COICOP categories for publication in Table 6.2 of the Blue Book. \n\nRecommendation: Better understanding of the many adjustments and calculations used to compile UK HFCE is needed to determine which need to be carried out at a regional level. Adjustments are carried out to other data sources apart from the LCF, and conceptual differences may also apply to those, so all sources need to be reviewed as part of this recommendation.\n\nDue to the varied and numerous sources of data used for HFCE, there is no single measurement of the accuracy of HFCE. Although standard errors are available for LCF, and similar measures for other survey data, no such measures are available for the administrative data or data from the industry regulator. Accuracy for such sources could be indicated by the size of revisions from year to year. Where sample survey data is used, sampling and non-sampling errors can affect the output. Non-sampling errors are likely to affect the non-survey sources.\n\n####Sources\n\nThe main sources for measuring HFCE for the purpose of National Accounts are LCF, RSI and ABS. Where it is known that respondents to the LCF underestimate expenditure, such as alcohol and tobacco, alternative sources to the LCF are used, for example, administrative data from HMRC. \n\nThe table below illustrates the primary sources for each 2-digit COICOP category and the percentage value of each category in comparison to total HFCE.\n\n<ons-table path=\"2e144e06\" />\n\nA list of the secondary sources with a bit more detail can be found in the Annex, note this is taken directly from a Consumer Trends Publication^10^.\n\nThe total of the 12 COICOP categories provides an estimate of the domestic concept HFCE. Net tourism is added to this to estimate the national concept HFCE. Net trade is the expenditure by UK residents minus the expenditure of non-residents in the UK. Net trade is measured mostly by using the IPS.\n\nExpenditure by UK residents abroad includes traditional holiday spending, as well as expenditure by UK forces and UK government employees stationed abroad, and outward imputed rental, that is the housing services the owner occupier consumes whilst living in their home abroad. Outward imputed rental is currently sourced from our Trade branch. This is added to domestic concept HFCE.\n\nExpenditure in the UK by non-residents is also obtained from the IPS. It covers expenditure by foreign students, members of the USA forces stationed in the UK, non-UK government employees and inward imputed rental. USA forces data is sourced from the Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA). It also includes inward imputed rental. This is subtracted from national concept HFCE.\n\nCategories which use historic forecasts to estimate data have been prioritised for review by HFCE so that alternative data sources can be found. \n\n####Living Costs and Food Survey\n\nAs is seen in the table above, the LCF is the main source for many COICOP categories. The LCF is a voluntary household expenditure survey^11^. It is a sample survey of private households and as such does not include people living in residential homes, hostels, hotels, boarding houses nor other institutions. It defines a household as comprising of one person living alone or a group of people (not necessarily related) living at the same address who share cooking facilities and share a living room or sitting room or dining area. \n\nRecommendation: As the LCF doesn’t collect information on institutions such as prisons, residential care homes nor halls, further investigations are needed to discover exactly how HFCE weight the LCF to account for this.\nData for the survey is presented as estimates of the average weekly expenditure of a UK household for NUTS1 regions by the LCF four-digit product breakdown categories, in the Family Spending publication as a three-year moving average^12^.\n\nLCF is used for 400 low-level directly compatible COICOP categories in HFCE so no adjustments for differences in classifications are needed for these categories. Not all LCF 4-digit categories are an exact match to the four digit COICOP categories breakdown used for HFCE due to the LCF using its own sequential numbering system. A mis-matched example is LCF 04.2 maintenance and repair of dwellings, whereas for HFCE COICOP 04.2 relates to Imputed rentals. At 2-digit breakdown there is an exact match for 01 to 12 between LCF and COICOP categories. \n\nThe main conceptual difference to note between the LCF and HFCE data is that the LCF collects data from UK resident households. Therefore in order to obtain domestic concept HFCE, 4-digit COICOP categories that are calculated using the LCF will need to have expenditure by non-UK residents added to them, where that spend is significant, for example, COICOP 11.1.1 restaurants and cafes, and 11.2 accommodation services. This supplementary data is sourced from IPS. \n\nRecommendation: Further investigation into whether the IPS data can be apportioned regionally. \n\nThe LCF collects expenditure of the household whilst abroad, but as previously mentioned IPS data is mostly used for expenditure abroad by UK residents.\n\nAnother conceptual difference is that LCF includes mortgage payments, but takes no account of owner-occupied imputed rental. Whereas HFCE for the purpose of national accounts, doesn’t include any mortgage payments but does included owner-occupied imputed rental.\n\nRecommendation: We are currently investigating improvements to regional owner occupier imputed rental in relation to other regional outputs. The requirements of HFCE should be considered as part of that project.\n\n\n####Reliability\n\nReliability of the LCF results is affected by three main issues:\n\n1. Non-response bias\n\n2. Sampling variability \n\n3. Inaccurate reporting of certain items\n\nLCF non-response bias is minimised by carrying out sample-based weighting using results from the 2001 Census linked study of non-responders (Further weighting is carried out to match the non-response weights to population totals in order to provide UK-level totals and means).\n\nSampling variability occurs due to a sample of the population being used, rather than the whole population. The difference between the sample results and the true population statistics is estimated by the standard error. A full list of estimated standard errors for LCF two to 5-digit categories of expenditure can be found in Table A1^13^.\n\nInaccurate reporting of certain items on the LCF is reduced by having in-built checks in the computer assisted personal interviewing program used during the interview part of the survey. Validation checks are also carried out on unusual values or changes in spending year on year. Outliers are also detected and treated, so that if extreme values are confirmed as correct, they’re still included, but only represent themselves rather than thousands of other households.\n\n####Notes for Introduction:\n\n1.

It would be measured according to NUTS areas.\n\nThe concept of HFCE would remain the same, that is the expenditure of a household, but adding in the regional dimension raises the question of what we wish to measure:\n\n1. The amount spent by households in that region.\n\n2. The amount spent by households of that region.\n\nTo answer this we must also consider what is published in the Blue Book. Regional HFCE will be constrained to Blue Book totals and would be consistent in terms of product breakdown. Table 6.2 of the Blue Book, as previously mentioned, presents HFCE as four main sections:\n\n1. Final consumption expenditure in the UK by resident and non-resident households.   \n\n2. Final consumption expenditure outside the UK by UK resident households.\n\n3. Final consumption expenditure in the UK by households resident in rest of the world.\n\n4. Final consumption expenditure by UK resident households in the UK and abroad.   \n\nThe first section of Table 6.2 covers domestic concept HFCE. If we apply this to regional HFCE it would cover the expenditure of resident and non-resident household in that region.  If we take UKC22 Tyneside, a NUTS3 region as an example, it would be the expenditure of every household resident in Tyneside, plus any expenditure in Tyneside by households resident in all other UK regions and the expenditure of non-UK resident households. \n\nThe second section, final consumption expenditure outside the UK by UK resident households, when related to the regions would cover expenditure incurred by a household outside their home region. For example the Tyneside household may visit UKD33 Manchester to purchase new clothing, or may go on holiday abroad and purchase food. This would be an import into the region.\n\nThe third section is final consumption expenditure in the UK by households resident in rest of the world. Regionally this would be expenditure in that particular region by households not resident in that region and those not resident in the UK, such as a UKD42 Blackpool household visiting Tyneside, or a tourist from abroad visiting Tyneside. This would be an export out of the region.\n\nThe fourth and final section is final consumption expenditure by UK resident households in the UK and abroad. This is the national concept HFCE, so is equal to the domestic concept plus imports minus exports. On a regional basis it would therefore cover all the expenditure of a household resident in that region in the region, plus any expenditure they incur outside their home region (whether in other regions in the UK or abroad). It would exclude any expenditure by non-resident households, whether they were from other regions in the UK or from abroad.\n\n###b) Measuring HFCE regionally\n\n####Regional availability of data\n\nAs can be seen from Table 1, the main sources of data used in the compilation of national HFCE are Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF), Retail Sales Inquiry (RSI) and Annual Business Survey (ABS), which are collected and processed by us and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). LCF data is available at Local Authority level, RSI and ABS data should be available at NUTS3.\n\nThe table below presents the sample sizes for NUTS1 regions (to the nearest 10) for the LCF in 2014. This information is available in Table 2.5^1^ of the Family Spending publication, based on the sample size for 2014 only.\n\nFurther sample sizes by single year are available in the Annex for NUTS1 regions based on current NUTS geography, and for NUTS3 based on 2008 NUTS geography.\n\n<ons-table path=\"6d80165f\" />\n\nThe overall response rate for Great Britain in 2014 was 48%. For Northern Ireland the response rate was 60%.  \n\nDetailed breakdown of number of responding households for the UK broken down by 2 to 5 digit categories can be found in Table A1^2^ of the Family Spending publication.\n\nA simpler breakdown of total number of responding households for Local Authorities is also available in the Annex.\n\nHere is the explanation of the LCF sample design as stated in the LCF Methodology^3^: “The LCF sample for Great Britain is a multi-stage stratified random sample with clustering. It is drawn from the small users file of the postcode address file (PAF) – the Post Office’s list of addresses. All Scottish offshore islands and the Isles of Scilly are excluded from the sample because of excessive interview travel costs. Postal sectors are the primary sample unit. 638 postal sectors are randomly selected after being arranged in strata defined by regions (sub-divided into metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas) and 2 variables from the 2001 Census: socio-economic group of the head of household and ownership of cars. These census variables were new stratifiers originally introduced for the survey year ending 1997, and updated following the results of the 2001 Census. The results of the 2011 Census will be used in due course. The Northern Ireland sample is drawn as a random sample of addresses from the Land and Property Services Agency list.”\n\nNo definition of Scottish offshore islands in terms of NUTS3 is currently available.  Information suggests that UKM64 Eilean Siar, UKM65 Orkney and UKM66 Shetland would be considered offshore.\n\nRecommendation: Further information needs to be obtained in order to clarify which Scottish islands are considered offshore for the purpose of the LCF. These then need to be mapped to NUTS3 areas to determine which areas are affected by being excluded from the LCF sample.\n\nIsles of Scilly are included with Cornwall as the NUTS3 region UKK30 Cornwall and Isles of Scilly.\n\nRecommendation: As the Isles of Scilly aren’t sampled, a method needs to be found as to how to treat it for the purpose of regional HFCE.\n\nWe conduct the survey fieldwork in Great Britain and NISRA conducts fieldwork in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland data is then sent to us for compilation and publication.\n\nRecommendation: Further information is needed regarding the Northern Ireland sample as data isn’t available in the LCF sample and number of responding household files used above for NUTS1 and 3.  When requesting this information, possibly from NISRA directly, need to also enquire about the sample boost for Northern Ireland and gain an exact date for when this will go ahead as will affect the quality of data available for Northern Ireland going forward.\n\nData provided by other government departments such as HMRC, Department for Transport, or Department for Education may be more likely to have NUTS3 data, and be more willing to share it.  This is likely to be true of sector regulators such as OFCOM, Office for Rail Regulation and the Gambling Commission.\n\nOther government data is used to compile regional owner-occupied imputed rental as already used in regional gross disposable household income (GDHI). We therefore already have data for a large proportion of regional HFCE.\n\nMost of the data collected for HFCE is at current price, however some sources such as alcohol-related data from HMRC and fuel from Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) are supplied as volume. HFCE then multiply this by an individual price to obtain current price estimates.\n\nMany of the other data suppliers are likely to collect regional information from households, such as the utilities companies, market research companies, service providers such as SKY plc, and the Association of British Insurers.  However the data is unlikely to be readily available at NUTS3 as they have collected the data for the purpose of providing services to customers.  They may collate regional data for their own internal use, as many businesses have their own office regions, but not for the purpose of sharing it with us. Businesses may have concerns over providing this data to us regarding confidentiality and competitors using this information to gain an advantage.\n\nRecommendation: Commercial contracts are held with some data suppliers, Regional Accounts should be involved in renegotiation of these contracts to see if we can obtain regional data.\n\nWe should also consider the impact of the data access legislation currently being reviewed which will provide us with greater access to detailed administrative government data. This would certainly improve our ability to obtain data from other government departments. Whether this would give us better access to the data held by the utilities companies, market research companies, service providers such as SKY plc, and the Association of British Insurers is yet to be determined. The risks of administrative data should be balanced against its availability, and as with all regional indicator datasets any new sources should be thoroughly quality assured.\n\n####ESA statements on regional HFCE\n\nESA states that a top-down method for regionalising HFCE is the norm due to a lack of suitable regional sources, and that it’s practically impossible to apply A-methods (which represent the actual values or approximate to the ideal as possible)^4^ for its compilation. This is because household budget surveys, such as Labour Force Survey (LFS) are of limited use due to their coverage that is only collect data for private households and not institutions.  Adjustments then also have to be made to account for imports and exports in and out of regions when data such as the RSI is used.\n\nInitial findings suggest that the majority of sources available to us would be B-method sources, that is they are acceptable alternatives to the actual values we’re trying to regionalise.\n\nI believe that we would have at least one A-method source of data; owner-occupied imputed rental as our regionalising method would use exactly the same data as is used to compile the national figure.\n\nOther sources, such as those used for categories that are currently being forecast are likely to be C-methods due to lack of national data to begin with.\n\n####Reliability\n\nDue to the nature of the compilation process of regional HFCE it will not be possible to estimate the accuracy of the estimates in terms of detailed statistical properties, for example through their standard errors. Therefore, the reliability of the estimates would be estimated by the extent of revisions.\n\nHeadline UK estimates will be affected by revisions to the Blue Book control totals, while revisions to NUTS1 and lower level estimates will come from revisions to the data used to apportion the UK HFCE estimates and Blue Book revisions.\n\nComparisons could be made with market research and any other regional expenditure outputs to judge the quality of the regional data. Volatility of the timeseries could be analysed, in line with comparison to the regional GDHI data. Our economists could provide guidance as to whether they think there is a strong enough correlation between income and expenditure to use this as a guide for measuring quality.\n\n####Scotland, Northern Ireland and EU countries\n\nScotland produces HFCE for Scotland using our published data in Table A35^5^ of the Family Spending publication.  Data is published as part of the Quarterly National Accounts Scotland (QNAS) at the 12 2-digit COICOP categories, which sums to domestic total.  They also include net tourism and national total (HFCE)^6^.\n\nRecommendation: Maintain open communication with Scottish government by regular updates on project progress.\n\nNorthern Ireland have published HFCE data as part of the development of their Supply and Use Tables (SUTs).\n\nOther EU countries are varied in their approach to regional HFCE.  Some do not produce regional HFCE at all, others produce it at NUTS1 only; but do not provide any COICOP breakdown, others do produce it at NUTS3 but use the same shares as disposable household income to apportion expenditure to the regions.  The common theme between all countries is that regional data is lacking or not of high enough quality to provide a very low level of detail.\n\nMore information is available for compilation methods of Scotland, Northern Ireland and other EU countries in the Annex.\n\n###c) Further points to explore before going ahead\n\n####Users\n\nUsers will need to be consulted to see whether our proposed methods and outputs will meet their needs.\n\n####Sources\n\nBefore proceeding any further we need to fully evaluate the sources being used to compile the HFCE data in Blue Book. This will involve further investigation into:\n\n1. Which source(s) is being used for each COICOP 4-digit category.\n\n2. Are these volume or price sources?\n\n3. The regional availability for each source, that is, is the data received by HFCE at UK level from the supplier, or any other level and summed to UK by the HFCE team?\n\n4. Where the source is not currently supplied at a regional level, can it be provided at a regional level?\n\n5. If yes to the above, what is the lowest level available? NUTS3 is the preferred.\n\n6. If current sources are not available regionally, alternative sources will need to be found for use as indicator datasets. \n\n7. If no alternative sources can be found, we may need to model based on LCF.\n\nAlternative sources will be found through:\n\n1. At desk research.\n\n2. Collaboration with internal Household Expenditure branch regarding existing data and potential sources discovered but not yet in use.\n\n3. Collaboration with internal Admin Data Division to identify any potential sources on the Admin Sources and Information Asset Register (ASIAR), that is, sources we already use, and find new sources of administrative data we are not currently using. \n\n4. Hack days – internal cross divisional sessions whereby interested parties collaborate to find new or alternative sources to data currently being used.\n\n5. Collaboration with the devolved administrations.\n\nThe above will give us a better idea of the level of product breakdown we'll be able to publish.  Once all sources have been identified they will need rigorous quality assurance to ensure they are fit for purpose.\n\n####LCF\n\nSample sizes will affect the quality of data available for certain regional areas.  This will need to be investigated further, including the number of responding households.\n\nLCF doesn't have data readily available at a lower level than 2-digit. With advance notice, LCF can compile data at a 4-digit level which we can the match/map to 4-digit COICOP categories, once we’ve identified which categories in UK HFCE used LCF as the data source.\n\n####Net Tourism and cross border tourism\n\nAs mentioned above, imports have to be added to the domestic concept HFCE and exports subtracted to produce national concept HFCE. At a UK level this isn’t a problem as we have data for total imports and exports to and from the UK. At a regional level it may be more difficult to measure due to cross border domestic tourists.  Expenditure incurred by UK-based residents abroad can be provided by the IPS as the survey asks where the respondent lives.  The data is currently only available for England Scotland Wales and London.  IPS are working on compiling this data at a NUTS1 level, but it may be a while before it’s available.  Once the NUTS1 data is available, we could use NUTS3 data, on holiday spending from the LFS to breakdown the NUTS1 IPS data to lower regions.\n\nIPS data could also be used for non-UK residents visiting the UK, along with Visit England data. \n\nOther sources to investigate include the HMRC quarterly Regional Trade Statistics publication, and a recently published article of ours on estimating the value of services exports abroad from the English regions, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nRecommendation: Detailed investigation of data available for regional imports and exports.\n\nDomestic cross border tourism is broader than the general sense of someone going on holiday.  It could cover a person travelling from one region to another to buy a car, visit a large shopping centre or visit a family attraction, and services such as buying insurance or lottery tickets online. So is only a concern for regional HFCE, at a national level it has no impact.  \n\nClothing data in the HFCE comes from the RSI, which would be collected on a business location basis.  Due to this it would be impossible to determine how much of that data relates to the expenditure of the residents of that area and to non-residents, so it would not be possible to subtract their expenditure determine the national concept of HHCFE.  This could skew the data for certain areas upwards, such as UKL22 Cardiff and Vale of Glamorgan and allocate a large proportion to COICOP 3 Clothing and Footwear due to the large shopping centre in Cardiff, as people travel in to the city to buy clothing.  Data for other regions could be pushed down due to lack of shopping centres and people travelling out of their region to purchase.\n\nThe LFS does not have a breakdown of region of spend to assist with this.\n\nRecommendation: Investigate the impact of cross-border domestic tourism; may have greater impact at lower region levels, as people are more likely to travel within reasonable distances for regularly purchased goods and services. May have less impact at a higher level as people won’t travel as far, will also have less impact on the larger good and/or services that are purchased infrequently.\n\n####Changes in the economy\n\nWe are [currently investigating the sharing economy][1], that is, activities that are facilitated by digital platforms which enable people or businesses to share property, resources, time and skills, such as Uber and Airbnb. As many of these services are offered by households who own the particular good used to provide the service, (for example, a car for the provision of a “taxi service” via Uber) to another household, the information isn’t collected through business surveys.  Consequently if the data feeds into a COICOP category that isn’t estimated by the LCF we may be under-representing a large part of this type of expenditure by households nationally and consequently regionally. \n\nThe increase in internet shopping may also affect data which is collected on business location.\n\n####National and domestic concept, and savings ratio\n\nSince regional GDHI is calculated for the resident population of a region, it is clear that we need to measure HFCE by the national concept in order to leave net savings and derive the savings ratio for a region.  It is less clear whether there is a need for us to measure HFCE by the domestic concept, so we should consult with users to establish their needs, as described above.\n\nMy research indicates that UK HFCE is compiled on a domestic concept basis, and net tourism is then added to reach national concept UK HFCE due to conceptual differences in data sources. Different users may have different requirements, and these may change over time I therefore advocate that the new system for compiling regional HFCE is set up to produce and output regional data based on the domestic concept, net tourism, and national concept of HFCE, regardless of user needs, but that we publish data that will meet user needs.\n\nRecommendation: System used for compilation of regional HFCE is set up to process and output domestic concept, net tourism, and national concept HFCE as separate series for each region.\n\n####Notes for Regional HFCE\n\n1.

It discussed the drivers for the work, definitions and terminology at a national level and regionally, and data sources. \n\nThere are three methods in my opinion that could be used to measure regional household final consumption expenditure (HFCE).\n\n1. Use Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) data to apportion UK HFCE to NUTS3 regions and aggregate to NUTS2 and then NUTS1.\n\n2. Obtain a regional breakdown of all the sources that feed into UK HFCE at NUTS3.\n\n3. Obtain a regional breakdown of as many sources that feed into UK HFCE and alternative sources for those not available at NUTS3.\n\nThere are advantages and limitations to each. With the first method for example, it would be a very simple method where we’d obtain the proportion of expenditure for each 4-digit COICOP category for each NUTS3 region from raw LCF data, and apply this to the UK HFCE data. We’d have to first sum the 4-digit LCF categories to match the 4-digit classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP) categories in HFCE, and then map the remainder to the most appropriate categories. We’d then use this matched or mapped LCF data at NUTS3 to apportion UK HFCE. As this is similar to the method used by Scottish government to calculate Scottish HFCE, I’d expect them to have a document that matches or maps LCF categories to COICOPs readily available.\n\nProvided there is good sample coverage, I believe this method could work to provide us with rough estimates of regional HFCE, which would be in line with what Scottish government produces for Scotland. However, for some of the LCF categories with a high standard error there may be concerns over the quality of data produced by this method. The method also doesn’t account for any of the adjustments made by HFCE, neither will it include any data for apportioning owner-occupied imputed rental nor expenditure on prostitution to the regions.\n\nThe second method would be the ideal method as it involves procuring the regional data that underpins the national level data that feeds into UK HFCE. Much of this data, (Labour Force Survey, Retail Sales Inquiry, Annual Business Survey) is likely to be available regionally, see below for further discussions. Yet the main limitation for this method is that some of the national data is historical and forecast. It is therefore highly unlikely that there’ll be a regional source for this data if the national data does not exist.\n\nThe third method is most likely to be used in practice. It is an approach similar to how regional gross value added (GVA) and gross disposable household income (GDHI) is measured, in that regional indicator datasets would be used to regionally apportion Blue Book data. Some of the GVA and GDHI indicator datasets are the regional breakdown of the data used in the National Accounts, and others are approximations to the national dataset.\n\nIn theory this is possible, again there are limitations to being able to do this in practice:\n\n1. Regional data may not be available at all, not even a close approximation.\n\n2. Regional data may not be available at the lowest level, NUTS3.\n\n3. Regional data may be available at the lowest level, but may not be robust enough to be used as an indicator dataset.\n\n4. As mentioned above, for method 2; where forecasts are used, there’s low probability of finding regional data, or even approximate data sets, if the national data doesn’t actually exist.\n\n5. Conceptual measurements differences apply to sources; LCF for example will only cover UK resident private households.  The RSI on the other hand collects data from retailers who will not be able to distinguish whether goods are sold to UK residents or non-residents, private households or institutions.  Some sources thus supply data on the national concept and others on the domestic concept principle or don’t provide full sector coverage.\n\n6. Many adjustments are applied to national data, which may need to be applied to regional data sources.  \n\nIn conclusion it should be possible to produce regional HFCE depending on the availability and quality of lower region data. The main sources (Living Costs and Food Survey, RSI and ABS) are all available regionally at NUTS3. I think there is a strong probability that the data provided by other government departments and sector regulators would be available now, but if not I believe the data access legislation would improve our chances of gaining access to the lowest level data. Privately supplied data may not be available at the lower level, but I think we would have enough data sources available to calculate a reasonable estimate at the NUTS1 or 2 level, and then possibly use the LCF to breakdown further. I think we’ll be using a mix of bottom-up and top-down approach to calculate regional HFCE, for some COICOP categories we’d aggregate the lower regions to the higher, with others we’d use a direct match one indicator dataset to break the national data to NUTS1, then due to availability of data sources at the lower regional level, would need to use approximate indicator datasets at lower regional levels.\n\nOur goal is to publish the same product breakdown as the Blue Book for all NUTS1, 2 and 3 regions. However, data sources will be the main driver behind the level of product breakdown we can produce. We may not be able to produce such a detailed breakdown, for example, we may only be able to produce durable goods, semi-durable goods, non-durable goods and services data, without the COICOP breakdown for each for NUTS1, 2 and 3. On the other hand we may be able to go down to the 2-digit COICOP level, but only at a NUTS1 geographical level as there isn’t sufficient coverage by data sources at NUTS2 and 3.\n\nWhile the report gave an overview of data currently used for the production of national level HFCE there is still a lot more work to be done in researching these sources so that they could be used at a regional level.  The national Household Expenditure branch in ONS are constantly reviewing the sources they use so there needs to be a lot of collaboration between Household Expenditure branch and Regional Accounts to assist each other in finding alternative, improved sources that provide national and regional information in relation to HFCE.\n\nRecommendations are also listed below that need to be completed before the project goes ahead.\n\n####Recommendations:\n\n1. Better understanding of the many adjustments and calculations used to compile UK HFCE is needed to determine which need to be carried out at a regional level.\n\n2. As the LCF doesn’t collect information on institutions such as prisons, residential care homes nor halls, further investigations are needed to discover exactly how HFCE gross up the LCF to account for this.\n\n3. Further investigation into whether IPS data can be apportioned regionally, where used to supplement LFS data to produce domestic concept HFCE.\n\n4. Ensure regional HFCE is considered as part of wider project to improve owner-occupied imputed rental.  \n\n5. Obtain clarification on which Scottish islands are considered offshore for the purpose of the LCF, and map these to NUTS3 areas to determine which areas are affected by being excluded from the LCF sample.\n\n6. Determine a suitable method for the Isles of Scilly where LCF data is used; the Isles are not sampled.\n\n7. Gain better understanding of LCF Northern Ireland sample size and number of responding households.  Also enquire about the probable date of the future sample boost for Northern Ireland.\n\n8. Ensure open communication is maintained with Scottish government as to project progress.\n\n9. Regional Accounts to be involved in renegotiation of any commercial contracts relating to access to data used in HFCE.\n\n10. Detailed investigation of data available for regional imports and exports.  \n\n11. Investigation into the impact of cross-border domestic tourism.\n\n12. System used for compilation of regional HFCE is set up to process and output domestic concept, net tourism, and national concept HFCE as separate series for each region.","title":"Conclusion"},{"markdown":"###Methods of compilation used by Scotland, Northern Ireland and EU countries\n\n####Scotland\n\nAs mentioned above, Scotland publishes domestic total household final consumption expenditure (HFCE) by 12 2-digit  classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP) categories, net tourism and national total HFCE. They define their domestic concept of HFCE as “final consumption in Scotland by Scottish and non-resident (including RUK) households” (RUK equates to the rest of the UK). They define their national concept as “final consumption by Scottish households in Scotland and abroad (including RUK)”. Their net tourism is “final consumption by Scottish households abroad (holiday spending) less final consumption in Scotland by non-resident households (tourist expenditure)”. \n\nData is processed at a low level using the Scottish proportions from the Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) for the relevant category and summed to produce COICOP 2-digit level data for all data bar narcotics (COICOP 02.3), prostitution (COICOP 12.2) and owner-occupied imputed rentals (COICOP 04.2.1). For narcotics, they use the same method as we use for the national accounts. For owner-occupied imputed rentals they produce their own imputed rental data.\n \n####Northern Ireland\n\nAs stated above Northern Ireland is in the process of developing their SUTs and as part of this have published HFCE data for Northern Ireland at Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS)1 and 2^1^. (Northern Ireland is the same size and name region at NUTS1 and 2.)  The data is split by classification of product activity (CPA), that is the classification of products; goods and services, at the level of the EU, as data in Supply and Use Tables (SUTs) are classified by CPA.\n\nNorthern Ireland is also working on producing a HFCE matrix which will mirror the HFCE table in our SUTs^2^. The data are still experimental so have not yet been published. To produce their data on a COICOP 2-digit basis they map Living Costs and Food survey data to COICOP categories and then use the UK HFCE table to disaggregate the totals across the CPA codes.\n\nAs the LCF does not include communal household establishments such as care homes or university halls of residence, adjustments are made to the data by using Census and Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.\n\nThe LCF data used is a 3-year average due to the small sample size; fewer than 200 households for Northern Ireland. To improve the robustness of their data, Northern Ireland have received funding to boost their sample size this year.\n\nThey produce data on a domestic and national concept basis.  Tourist expenditure data required to produce the national concept data is based on data from our International Passenger Survey (IPS), and data published by Visit England and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA).\n\n####European Union\n\nA very limited number of EU countries produce regional HFCE. If they do, it’s at NUTS1 with very limited product breakdown, for example, Germany produces regional HFCE at NUTS1 using the total expenditure of households data from their survey of income and expenditure, which isn’t based on COICOP 2-digit categories. Hungary for example only produces regional HFCE at NUTS1 by 2-digit COICOP.\n\nNorway is the odd one out in that it does produce HFCE at current prices at NUTS3, but it only produces it as a total HFCE figure (that is, no category breakdown).  As Norway has regional data for disposable household income but lack regional data for household expenditure, it uses the same regional shares as disposable household income to apportion household expenditure to the regions.\n\nSpain produces HFCE at NUTS2 at a 2-digit breakdown, and has done so since 2000. They, similar to the UK, use a household budget survey as the main source, which is supplemented by administrative data and prices information.\n\n###Secondary sources used for the compilation of UK household final consumption expenditure\n\nInformation in this table is taken directly from the [Consumer Trends: Sources document][1].\n\n<table class=\"tg\" style=\"width:700px\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n        <th style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">COICOP</th>\n        <th colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">Product group name</th>\n\n        <th style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">Secondary data sources</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n\n  <tbody style=\"vertical-align:top\">\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">1</td>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">Food and non-alcoholic beverages</td>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">Food and non-alcoholic beverages</td>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">LCF provides a detailed record of expenditure on food brought into the home.

The price data obtained from the survey are used to derive both current expenditure and estimates at previous year prices in order to derive chained volume measures.<br>Separate data are provided for outlets licensed to sell for consumption off the premises (off-licence trade  retail shops and so on) from those licensed for consumption of alcohol on the premises (licensed trade  restaurants, public houses and so on). This information has been used to derive separate estimates of household expenditure for the two appropriate COICOP categories: 2.1 alcoholic beverages  off-licence trade; and 11.1.1 restaurants, cafés, pubs and the like  licensed trade.<br>Estimates for tobacco are based on data obtained from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) relating to the quantities of tobacco released for sale within the UK. Relevant components of the CPI are used to convert this volume data into current and chained volume measure estimates. <br>Estimates of household expenditure on alcoholic drink and tobacco smuggled into the UK are made from 1994. These are based on HMRC intelligence on the level of smuggling, including freight smuggling and diversion fraud, taking place together with assumptions on the prices at which the goods are sold to final consumers through different types of outlet. For alcohol, retail shops and restaurants are assumed to sell the goods at the same prices as the rest of their stock. For street sales (that is not through off-licences or restaurants), 70 per cent of the average legal UK price is used for beer and 115 per cent of the French prices (published by the French Statistical Institute, INSEE) for wines and spirits. For tobacco, the prices at which smuggled goods are bought by UK households are assumed to be slightly above Belgian market prices, although the goods are not necessarily regarded as having been sourced from Belgium. <br>Estimates of illegal narcotics are derived from Home Office “Drugs Misuse Declared” statistics derived from the Crime Survey from England and Wales and purity data derived from police seizures, and from United Nations price data.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td rowspan=\"6\" style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">3</td>\n        <td rowspan=\"6\" style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">Clothing and footwear</td>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">a.     Clothing materials (03.1.1)</td>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">a.     ABS and RSI</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">b.    Garments (03.1.2)</td>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">b.     ABS and RSI</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">c.     Other articles of clothing and clothing accessories (03.1.3)</td>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">c.     ABS and RSI</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">d.    Cleaning and hire of clothing (03.1.4)</td>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">d.     LCF</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">e.    Shoes and other footwear (03.2.1)</td>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">e.     ABS and RSI</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">f.      Repair and hire of footwear (03.2.2)</td>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">f.      LCF</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td rowspan=\"7\" style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">4</td>\n        <td rowspan=\"7\" style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">Housing, water, electricity gas and other fuels</td>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">a.     Actual and imputed housing rentals (04.1, 04.2)</td>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">a. Estimates for housing rentals make use of private sector data from the LCF and public sector rented dwellings data supplied by local authorities to the (DCLG) and to the Scottish government and the Wales and Northern Ireland Offices. Estimates of rent receipts by Housing Associations and public corporations are also included. In order to construct chained volume measures, the number of occupied dwellings is used as a volume indicator. This indicator is based on total housing stock data, less estimates of unoccupied dwellings, supplied by DCLG and adjusted by a quality factor to take account of overall improvements in the housing stock over time. Changes have been made to the method for calculating nominal (current price) rentals data in Household Final Consumption Expenditure (HFCE). This is in order to more closely align the annual growth (quarter on corresponding quarter of the previous year) of household expenditure on actual and imputed rentals with the annual growth of comparable CPIH data series  CPIH is a measure of consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers housing costs (OOH). <br>The average value for rented accommodation is revised from 2010 onwards  the impact has caused revisions to the HFCE implied deflator. From 2011, the quarter on quarter of previous year growths of the relevant rental implied deflators, track the relevant CPIH (OOH) growths. This change does not mean that the implied deflator for HFCE on actual and imputed rental will fully match the equivalent measure from CPIH as differences in the method and source data for stocks of housing will continue. With publication of Blue Book 2014, this method is now implemented for growth into Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2011. To achieve this, 2010 data has been adjusted and is used to link the old basis data using the Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF), with the data based on relevant CPIH data (including OOH). Estimates of real HFCE and real GDP (chained volume measures) are unaffected by this change. Current price estimates prior to 2010 are also unaffected. For a detailed explanation of this change see the article published on 3 September 2014.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">b.    Materials for the maintenance and repair of the dwelling (04.3.1)</td>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">b.     ABS and RSI</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">c.     Services for maintenance and repair of the dwelling (04.3.2)</td>\n        <td style=\"padding: 10px 5px;text-align: left;border: 1px solid black;\">c.     Based on the LCF.

Devolution policy to city regions, the development of an industrial strategy and the Brexit vote have all led to greater focus on the relative performance of different parts of the country and a focus on particular industries.  This article seeks to provide some useful information on the distribution of employment across the country, particularly focusing on individual industries and in identifying those areas of the country specialising in them.\n\nUsing the interactive map and datasets associated with the release, it is possible for you to investigate the data for different industries and different areas of the country and this article has been designed with this purpose in mind. The article highlights just a small number of industry and location examples to provide some insight into the data available. \n","title":"Introduction"},{"markdown":"This article uses the number of employees by industry to examine the spatial distribution of industries and industrial specialisation in the 39 [Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS)][1] 2 areas in Great Britain. In England, NUTS 2 areas correspond to counties or groups of counties, in Wales NUTS 2 areas are equivalent to groups of unitary authorities and in Scotland they are broadly combinations of council areas and local enterprise companies (LECs). NUTS 1 areas correspond to English regions and the countries of Scotland and Wales. \n\nThe main analysis technique used is the calculation of location quotients. Location quotients are used to assess both the industrial specialisation of local areas and the geographical concentration of industries.\n\nIn the context of geographical concentration, a location quotient of 1.0 indicates that the local share of total employee jobs in an industry is equal to the local share of total employee jobs relative to Great Britain. A location quotient greater than 1.0 indicates a relative concentration of the industry in the geographic area while a location quotient of less than 1.0 indicates there is not a relative concentration of that industry in the area. For example, if an area has 5% of all employee jobs in Great Britain overall and also has 5% of employee jobs in Great Britain in industry X, then that area will have a location quotient of 1.0 for that industry. If the area has more than 5% of all employee jobs in Great Britain in industry X, then its location quotient for that industry will be greater than 1.0, indicating a concentration of that industry in the area relative to Great Britain. More information and examples of geographical concentration can be found in section 4 of this article. \n\nWhen used in the context of industrial specialisation, a location quotient of 1.0 indicates that the local share of employee jobs in an industry is equal to Great Britain’s share of employee jobs in that industry. A value above 1.0 indicates an area has a relative specialism in the industry. For example, if 5% of employee jobs in Great Britain occur in industry X, then any area which also has 5% of its employee jobs in that same industry will have a location quotient for industry X of 1.0. If the area has more than 5% of its employee jobs in industry X, then its location quotient for that industry will be greater than 1.0. Therefore, the higher the location quotient the more an area has a specialisation in that industry relative to Great Britain overall. In this article a location quotient value of 2 or more has been used to identify particular relative specialisms in an industry. Industrial specialisation results can be found in section 5 of this article. \n\nIn addition to location quotients, the analysis in this article also uses the Krugman index, a relative specialisation measure which compares the industrial structures of 2 geographical areas. It runs from zero, if an area has the same employee jobs split across industries as the reference area, to 2 if they have employee jobs in entirely different industries to each other. Results from the Krugman index can also be found in section 5 of this article. \n\nThe Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), used in this article, is a hierarchical 5-digit system, which provides a framework for the collection, tabulation, presentation and analysis of data. [UK SIC (2007)][2] is divided into 21 sections, each denoted by a single letter from A to U. The letters of the sections can be uniquely defined by the next breakdown, the divisions (denoted by 2 digits). The divisions are then broken down into groups (3 digits), then into classes (4 digits) and, in several cases, again into subclasses (5 digits). In this article, data are provided for the industry sections, divisions and groups only. There are 21 sections, 88 divisions and 272 groups. \n\nFor further information on the calculation methods for location quotients and the Krugman index, see the Quality and methodology section. \n\n\n  [1]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/overview\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007","title":"Things you need to know about this release "},{"markdown":"In some industries, employee jobs are concentrated in a small number of areas and therefore these industries have a high level of geographical concentration. The areas that have concentrations of employees in an industry may be spread across the country or they may be located together in neighbouring areas. Conversely, in some industries, employee jobs are spread relatively evenly across the country and therefore have very little geographical concentration. Spatial patterns for all sectors, together with the different divisions (SIC 2 industries) that make up the sector, can be examined in detail via our interactive map.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc403/lqmaps/index.html\" />\n\nThe following analysis focuses on these patterns of spatial distribution for examples of a few selected industries. The location quotient concentration tool, available in the datasets accompanying this article, can also show which regions, NUTS 2 or local authority areas have concentrations of employee jobs within the industry being examined. \n\n###Professional, scientific and technical activities\n\nWithin Great Britain, a spatial concentration of employees is seen particularly in some of the knowledge-intensive service industries such as information and communication, and professional, scientific and technical activities. Figure 1 shows the location quotients for the professional, scientific and technical activities sector (Section M of the 2007 UK SIC) for each region as well as Scotland and Wales. \n\n<ons-image path=\"a067859c\" />\n\nThe professional, scientific and technical activities sector is concentrated in London. In 2015, London had over one and a half times the share of employee jobs in professional, scientific and technical activities (location quotient 1.6) compared with London’s share of total employee jobs. Employee jobs in professional, scientific and technical activities were also relatively concentrated in the South East and East of England. Both also had location quotients greater than 1.0 indicating that their local shares of employee jobs in this industry were greater than their share of total employee jobs. The area with the lowest relative share of employee jobs in the professional, scientific and technical activities sector was Wales, which had just over half the share of employee jobs in professional, scientific and technical activities (location quotient 0.6) compared with the share of total employee jobs in Wales. \n\nThe professional, scientific and technical activities sector is made up of 9 SIC 2 industries including legal and accounting activities, management consultancy, architectural and engineering activities and scientific research and development.  Location quotients by NUTS 1 region for scientific and development are shown in Figure 2.\n\n<ons-image path=\"0abb87e2\" />\n\nAt a regional level, employee jobs in scientific research and development were concentrated in the East of England and the South East. The North East and Scotland also had location quotients greater than 1 indicating their shares of employee jobs in scientific research and development were higher relative to their share of total employee jobs in Great Britain. There were low relative shares of employee jobs in scientific research and development in the Midlands, Wales and the North West. London also had a low relative share of employee jobs in scientific research and development although had the highest location quotient for the professional, scientific and technical activities sector overall. This was because London had high concentrations of employee jobs in other SIC 2 industries within the sector, in particular the activities of head offices and advertising and market research.\n\nAt the NUTS 2 level, employee jobs in scientific research and development were highly concentrated in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire in the South East and East Anglia in the East of England. In both areas the share of employee jobs in scientific research and development was 3 and a half times greater than their share of all employee jobs in Great Britain.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"a7768460\" />\n\nFigure 4 shows that employee jobs in scientific research and development were clustered around the South East and East of England. Clusters of employee jobs in scientific research and development can also be seen around Eastern Scotland and North Eastern Scotland as well as Tees Valley and Durham, and North Yorkshire. \n\n<ons-image path=\"d1bf1382\" />\n\n###Financial and insurance activities\n\nThe financial and insurance activities sector (Section K) also displays strong geographical concentration in Great Britain. The majority of NUTS 2 areas had a relatively small share of employee jobs in financial and insurance activities, compared with their share of national employee jobs. However, the 2 Inner London NUTS 2 areas, Inner London East and Inner London West both had high concentrations of employee jobs in the sector. \n\nThe financial and insurance activities sector is composed of 3 SIC 2 industries: financial service activities, insurance activities and activities auxiliary to financial and insurance services. Financial service activities and activities auxiliary to financial and insurance services, were highly concentrated in London. Insurance activities were highly concentrated in the South East and Wales. \n\nFigure 5 shows the NUTS 2 areas that had the highest location quotients for the financial service activities SIC 2 industry. Aside from a high concentration in central London, the financial service activities industry was also concentrated in a few other NUTS 2 areas. After the two Inner London NUTS 2 areas, Eastern Scotland had the next highest location quotient at 1.7, followed by West Yorkshire (1.6). \n\n<ons-chart path=\"58dbff6d\" />\n\nAside from the areas in London and Scotland, Figure 6 shows that the other areas where employee jobs in financial service activities are concentrated are spread across the country, for example, West Yorkshire and the West Midlands. \n\n<ons-image path=\"73e44b06\" />\n\n###Manufacturing\n\nThe manufacturing sector (Section C) has a more mixed spatial distribution. Figure 7 shows the location quotients for each NUTS 1 region for the manufacturing sector. It shows that manufacturing employee jobs were concentrated in the East Midlands and the West Midlands. Manufacturing employee jobs were also highly represented in Wales and in the northern regions of England but virtually absent from London.\n\n<ons-image path=\"9d48c6f1\" />\n\nOne SIC 2 industry within the manufacturing sector is the manufacture of motor vehicles. Employee jobs in the manufacture of motor vehicles were highly concentrated in the West Midlands region, which accounted for a third of all employment in this sector nationally. In particular (shown in Figure 9), the NUTS 2 area of Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire had a high concentration of employee jobs in the manufacture of motor vehicles, with 4.6 times its share of employment in this industry than its share of total employee jobs in Great Britain.\n\n<ons-image path=\"716800b0\" />\n\nOutside the West Midlands, employee jobs in the manufacture of motor vehicles were also concentrated in the North East. Within the North East, Northumberland and Tyne and Wear had the greatest concentration of employees in the manufacture of motor vehicles, with its share of employees in this industry 3.4 times its share of total employee jobs in Great Britain. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"ee08f5d9\" />\n\nThe manufacture of chemicals is another industry within the manufacturing sector and displays a different spatial distribution to the manufacture of motor vehicles. Employee jobs in the manufacture of chemicals were concentrated in the north of England and not the Midlands. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"2e80e7b4\" />\n\nEmployee jobs in the manufacture of chemicals were highly concentrated in Tees Valley and Durham in the North East. Four of the 5 NUTS 2 areas in the North West also appeared among the NUTS 2 areas with the highest location quotients, shown in Figure 10. These concentrations in the north of England can be seen in Figure 11. In the south of England the NUTS 2 areas with relative concentrations in the manufacture of chemicals (Kent, East Anglia, and Dorset and Somerset) were dispersed. \n\n<ons-image path=\"f8f9ed37\" />","title":"The spatial distribution of industries"},{"markdown":"Industrial specialisation looks at the industrial structure of a particular area. Location quotient specialisation tools for NUTS 1 regions, NUTS 2 areas and local authorities are available in the datasets accompanying this article and allow you to investigate the industrial specialisations of areas of your choice. The examples in this section demonstrate output from the tool for 3 selected geographical areas at 3 different levels of industrial breakdown. \n\n###Industrial specialisation by NUTS 2 area\n\nFor the 39 NUTS 2 areas, data are available for up to 84 SIC 2 industries. Figure 12 displays the 10 SIC 2 industries with the highest location quotients in Surrey, East and West Sussex. There were 3 SIC 2 industries for which the location quotient was 2 or above, indicating particular relative specialisms in Surrey, East and West Sussex in these industries. Air transport was the industry with the highest relative specialism followed by insurance, reinsurance and pension funding. For both industries the share of employee jobs in Surrey, East and West Sussex was around 3 times the national share of employment in these industries.\n\nIt should be noted that this section examines the relative specialism of an area. This means that for an area, the share of employee jobs in an industry is not examined by itself (absolute specialism) but it is compared with the share of employee jobs in that industry in Great Britain. These location quotients therefore give a picture relative to Great Britain. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"e847f639\" />\n\n###Industrial specialisation by NUTS 1 region\n\nFor the 11 NUTS 1 regions, data are available for up to 259 SIC 3 industries. Figure 13 displays the 8 highest location quotients for SIC 3 industries in the West Midlands. The West Midlands is shown to be most specialised in the manufacture of other porcelain and ceramic products, with its share of employee jobs in this industry over 7 times the share of employee jobs in the industry in Great Britain. All of the SIC 3 industries displayed in Figure 13 with the highest location quotients in the West Midlands were within the manufacturing sector. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"31cf95d5\" />\n\n###Industrial specialisation by local authority\n\nFor local authorities, data are available for up to 19 industrial sectors. Figure 14 displays the location quotients by industrial sector for the local authority of North Warwickshire. North Warwickshire had a high relative specialism in transportation and storage, with a location quotient of 4.3. North Warwickshire’s relative share of jobs in construction, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail trade was also greater than the share of jobs in Great Britain in these sectors. \n\n<ons-image path=\"fcd24162\" />\n\n###Comparing industrial structures between areas\n\nThis section uses the Krugman index to examine how similar or dissimilar an area’s industrial structure is relative to the industrial structure of Great Britain overall. Broadly, areas with particular specialisms are likely to be seen as more dissimilar to either Great Britain overall or to most other areas. A lower Krugman index score (up to a value of 2) indicates a more similar industrial structure and a higher Krugman index score indicates a more dissimilar industrial structure. A tool is provided that allows the comparison of industrial structure between areas as well as against Great Britain. \n\nFirstly, comparing the industrial structures of regions in turn showed the South East and the East of England had the most similar industrial structures, with the lowest Krugman index score of 0.24. London came out as the most dissimilar region to all other regions and was also the most dissimilar to Great Britain overall. \n\nFigure 15 shows the Krugman index scores for each of the NUTS 1 regions against the West Midlands. Yorkshire and The Humber had the most similar industrial structure to the West Midlands followed by the East Midlands and the North West. London was the region that had the most dissimilar industrial structure to the West Midlands. The full Krugman index matrix for all regions can be viewed in the Krugman index tool, available in the datasets accompanying this article.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"08d86350\" />\n\nLooking at the industrial structures of NUTS 2 areas, Table 1 gives the NUTS 2 areas with the most and least similar industrial structures to Great Britain. Inner London West had the least similar industrial structure to Great Britain, followed by North Eastern Scotland. The most similar NUTS 2 area to Great Britain in terms of its industrial structure was Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Bath/Bristol area.\n\n<ons-table path=\"9d7317e9\" />\n\nThrough the tool it is also possible to compare the industrial structures of NUTS 2 areas with other NUTS 2 areas. An example of the areas with the most similar and most dissimilar industrial structures compared with Hampshire and the Isle of Wight can be seen in Table 2. \n\n<ons-table path=\"e7715318\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"Industrial specialisation "},{"markdown":"This article uses the number of employees by industry to examine the spatial distribution of industries and the relative industrial specialisation in NUTS 1 regions, NUTS 2 areas and local authorities. The number of employees by industry comes from the Business Register and Employment Survey ([BRES][1]) 2015. BRES is our primary source for jobs estimates at a detailed geographical and industrial level. It contains information on the number of employees by industry down to 5-digit industrial classification as defined in the UK Standard Industrial Classification ([SIC 2007][2]) and by geographic area down to local authority.\n\nThe term “employee job” is used throughout this article to emphasise that all the data in this article is focused on the workplace of an employee. However, it should be noted that strictly speaking the BRES data used in this article is not a count of the number of jobs filled by employees in an area, but rather a count of the number of employees who work in an area. Self-employed jobs, working proprietors and HM Forces and government-supported trainees are not included in the data. Estimates are subject to sampling error, which increase as geographic areas become smaller and industry classification becomes more detailed. \n\nFor some industries it has not been possible to calculate location quotients for all NUTS 2 areas because some industry data is disclosive. This can happen where employee jobs are concentrated in only a small number of firms and the number of employee jobs in such cases is likely to be low. However, where an industry in an area is dominated by one or a small number of very large plants or firms, then there may be a specialisation in that area, which it was not possible to show in the results due to this issue of data disclosure. \n\n###Location quotients\n\nLocation quotients can be considered as measures of either concentration or specialisation. The results produced are equivalent whichever method is used. \n\nFor concentration they are calculated as the quotient between the local share of employee jobs in a specific industry and the local share of national employee jobs. The formula is:\n\n<ons-equation path=\"b9f0bb0b\" />\n\nwhere Ei,r is the number of employee jobs in industry i region r, Ei is the number of employee jobs in industry i, Er is the number of employee jobs in region r and E is the number of employee jobs in Great Britain.\n\nA value of 1.0 means that region r has the same share of employee jobs in industry i as its share of national employee jobs. For example, region r has 4% of manufacturing employee jobs in Great Britain and also 4% of total employee jobs in Great Britain. A value greater than 1.0 means that region r has a higher share of employee jobs in industry i than its share of national employee jobs.\n\nLocation quotients can also be interpreted as a measure of industrial specialisation for local areas. In the context of specialisation they compare for each industry, the industry's share of local area employee jobs with its share of total employee jobs. The formula is:\n\n<ons-equation path=\"fa56d0fc\" />\n\nwhere Ei,r is the number of employee jobs in industry i region r, Er is the number of employee jobs in region r, Ei is the number of employee jobs in industry i and E is the number of employee jobs in Great Britain.\n\nA value of 1.0 means that an industry's share of employee jobs in region r is the same as its share of national employee jobs in Great Britain. For example, industry i makes up 5% of employee jobs in region r and also 5% of employee jobs in Great Britain. A value greater than 1.0 means that industry i makes up a larger share of employee jobs in the local area than at the national level.\n\n###Krugman index\n\nThe Krugman index is a relative specialisation measure that compares the industrial structures of 2 geographical areas. It runs from zero, if an area has the same employee jobs split across industries as the reference area, to 2 if they have employee jobs in entirely different industries to each other. \n\nThe equation for calculating the Krugman index is:\n\n<ons-equation path=\"431a96c4\" />\n \nwhere Ei,r are employee jobs in industry i in region r, Er is the total number of employee jobs in region r, Ei is total employee jobs in industry i and E is the national total of employee jobs.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/qmis/businessregisteremploymentsurveybresqmi\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007","title":"Quality and methodology"}],"_abstract":null,"latestRelease":false,"unit":null,"dateChanges":null,"versions":[],"relatedArticles":null,"entities":{"persons":["Kent"],"organizations":["BRES","Great Britain","NUTS","HM Forces","Bristol","Wales","Employment Survey","Eastern","Bath","UK Standard Industrial Classification","Standard Industrial Classification"],"locations":["Great Britain","South East","Bristol","London","England","Scotland","North","Inner London","Durham","East","Surrey"],"dates":["2007","2015","7317"]},"relatedData":[{"uri":"/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/locationquotientdataandgeographicconcentrationfornuts1nuts2andlocalauthorities"},{"uri":"/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/locationquotientdataandindustrialspecialisationfornuts2areas"},{"uri":"/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/locationquotientdataandindustrialspecialisationfornuts1areas"},{"uri":"/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/locationquotientdataandindustrialspecialisationforlocalauthorities"},{"uri":"/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/krugmanindexmatrix"}],"relatedMethodology":[],"preUnit":null},"matched_queries":["logged_featureset"]},{"fields":{"_ltrlog":[{"log_entry":[{"name":"1","value":0.0},{"name":"2","value":1.0318927}]}]},"_index":"article","_type":"document","_id":"AWA1nWfN90MS5JzXGf4t","_score":0.0,"_source":{"description":{"nextRelease":"","keywords":["Labour market","Self-employment","UK Economy"],"releaseDate":"2016-07-12T23:00:00.000Z","edition":"2001 to 2015","source":"","title":"Trends in self-employment in the UK","metaDescription":"","nationalStatistic":false,"_abstract":"Examines several characteristics of the recent growth in self-employment.","latestRelease":true,"unit":"","contact":{"name":"Philip Wales and Andrew Agyiri Amankwah","telephone":"+44 (0) 1633 651823","email":"macro@ons.gsi.gov.uk"},"preUnit":""},"edition":null,"section":null,"source":null,"type":"article","metaDescription":null,"contact":null,"relatedDocuments":[],"markdown":null,"links":[],"accordion":[],"releaseDate":null,"topics":[],"relatedDatasets":null,"uri":"/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/trendsinselfemploymentintheuk/2001to2015","nationalStatistic":false,"sections":[{"markdown":"The level of self-employment in the UK increased from 3.8 million in 2008 to 4.6 million in 2015. While this strong performance is among the defining characteristics of the UK’s economic recovery, the recent rise in self-employment is the extension of a trend started in the early 2000s.\n\nFull-time and part-time workers each account for around half of the rise in the absolute number of self-employed workers, but the growth rate of the part-time mode has been much stronger. Part time self-employment grew by 88% between 2001 and 2015, compared to 25% for the full-time mode. As a result, part-time self-employment accounts for 1.2 percentage points of the 1.6 percentage point increase in the self-employment share of all employment between 2008 and 2015.\n\nThe data presented here suggest that in general, self-employed workers are broadly content with their labour market status. Relatively few report negative reasons for becoming self-employed, few indicate that they are looking for alternative employment and among the part-timers, many respondents report that they would prefer not to work full-time. Evidence of under-employment is strongest among younger, male workers, who display a greater degree of dissatisfaction. \n\nThe number of self-employed workers has risen over the long term as a consequence of stronger in-flows from employment and unemployment offsetting a net out-flow to inactivity. These movements, as well as stronger intra-self-employment flows – movements from full-time to part-time self-employment in particular – suggest that recent growth in aggregate self-employment is in part related to workers managing their retirement in a different way to previously.\n\nAs groups, both the part-time and full-time self-employed have aged considerably over the last ten years and in excess of that indicated by simple demographics. The fraction employed in finance and business services has risen considerably, they are relatively concentrated in the South East and London, and changes in their usual hours worked have broadly followed trends for employees. ","title":"Main points"},{"markdown":"The performance of the labour market and the growth of self-employment have been among the defining characteristics of the UK’s recent economic recovery. The headline employment rate – which fell from 73.0% in Q1 2008 to 70.1% in Q3 2011 – recovered relatively quickly, aided in part by strong growth in self-employment. The level of self-employment increased by around 730,000 between 2008 and 2015: rising from 3.8 million to 4.6 million. Around half of this absolute change was accounted for by full-time self-employment, and around half by part-time self-employment. Although the growth of self-employment may have accelerated in recent years, this paper finds that these trends are better seen as a continuation of an existing, pre-downturn trend, extending from the early 2000s, only part of which can be explained by the evolution of demographics (see Section 2).\n\nWhile the absolute change in self-employment has been evenly divided between full- and part-time modes, the proportionate growth of the part-time mode, albeit from a lower base has been much stronger and has played an important role in raising the prevalence of self-employment overall. Part-time self-employment grew by 88% between 2001 and 2015 – compared with 25% for the full-time mode – and accounts for 1.2 percentage points of the 1.6 percentage point increase in the self-employment share of all employment between 2008 and 2015 (see Section 3). While full-time self-employment continues to account for the majority of self-employed workers, its share of employment and hours has grown somewhat less over the last 15 years (see Section 4). \n\nBelow the aggregate level, there are trends that are common to both full- and part-time self-employment. Both groups of workers have seen their age profile get markedly older in recent years, both are increasingly concentrated in the finance & business services industry, and changes in their average usual hours worked have broadly followed the trends of employees. Both groups are relatively concentrated in higher occupational groups and in the South East and London, with full-time self-employed workers in particular becoming more concentrated in the capital (Sections 3 and 4 ). \n\nThe evidence presented here suggests that, in general, self-employed workers are broadly content with their labour market status (Sections 3 and 4). Among older part-time self-employed workers in particular, there is little evidence of workers wanting a full-time position, of job search or of dissatisfaction with their self-employed status. Analysis also suggests that those moving from employee positions to self-employment tend to have somewhat higher pre-transition hourly earnings than workers moving to new employee positions: trends which are more consistent with workers making a positive choice, rather than being forced to be self-employed. Among younger and mid-aged self-employed women, in particular those working part-time, the growth in the incidence of self-employment has not been accompanied by growth in the number of people who would prefer to work full-time, nor a clear uptick in the number of workers seeking an alternative job. Among younger part-time self-employed men, however, the picture is less certain. Larger portions of these workers display a greater degree of dissatisfaction with their part-time status and appear to have come directly from unemployment – possibly indicating a choice made under economic hardship. It is among these workers that evidence of under-employment is strongest. \n\nThis paper also shows that self-employment has grown over the long term because the net in-flows from unemployment and other forms of employment have exceeded a net outflow to inactivity. During the economic downturn, the net flows from unemployment and from among employees fell markedly, but during the recovery which followed these net inflows grew in volume. The outflow to inactivity also declined markedly during the downturn – largely as a consequence of lower net outflows from part-time self-employment. This result is particularly striking given the age mix of the self-employed, which has shifted towards older workers over the recent years. \n\nThis paper also finds evidence of a growing number of workers moving between the full- and part-time modes of self-employment (Sections 3 and 4). While these growing intra-self-employment flows do not affect the headline number of self-employed workers, they are instructive. This may in part reflect changes in labour supply brought on by changes in demand conditions, as self-employed workers alter their hours in response to demand. However, older workers are also much more likely to make the transition from full-time to part-time self-employment than younger workers, and account for a large portion of the growth in this employment mode in recent years. These transitions appear to rarely involve a change of industry or occupation, and are consistent with workers choosing to manage their retirement in a different manner to previously. A larger number of older workers – and the full-time self-employed in particular – appear to be choosing to enter part-time self-employment, rather than retiring directly. \n\nThe results of this analysis broadly support and develop the findings of earlier papers, that the recent growth of self-employment is a continuation of a pre-existing, pre-downturn trend, but one which is only partly explained by demographics. Much of the growth in this mode of employment appears to be among workers managing their transition out of the labour market: choosing to work part-time for a period before moving to retirement. As a consequence, these data suggest that the growth of self-employment is a structural feature of the UK labour market which is unlikely to unwind with the economic recovery. Among younger workers the evidence is less clear. Although a relatively small component of self-employment, to the extent that the increase in dissatisfaction among younger male self-employed workers reflects under-employment, some of this labour supply may in time be redeployed to different uses as the recovery progresses.  \n","title":"Executive summary"},{"markdown":"Andrew Agyiri Amankwah and Philip Wales\n \nThe authors are grateful for contributions from colleagues at ONS, including from Ciaren Taylor, Malindi Myers, Nicholas Palmer, Fiona Massey, Peter Patterson, David Freeman, Christopher Watkins and Mark Franklin, as well as the Macroeconomic Analysis team.

The headline employment rate – which fell from 73.0% in Q1 2008  to 70.1% in Q3 2011 – recovered relatively quickly, aided in part by strong growth in self-employment (Figure 1). By Q1 2016, the employment rate had risen to a record high of 74.2%, and just over 4.7 million workers were self-employed . These trends, and in particular the strength of employment relative to GDP and the resulting weakness of productivity, have posed a challenge to economists’ understanding of the labour market (ONS, 2016a). Unprecedented in the UK’s post-war economic experience, these developments have raised questions about the extent to which the shift towards self-employment is a structural or a cyclical phenomenon, the degree to which it reflects “disguised unemployment” and about the changing nature of the UK labour market.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"52ab5836\" />\n\nThis paper sets out to explore these questions, drawing on official sources of information on the self-employed and proceeds as follows. The first section of the paper summarises headline trends, identifying several important characteristics of the recent growth in self-employment. The second and third sections examine trends in part- and full-time self-employment respectively. They examine the characteristics of self-employed workers in different modes and how these have changed through time, in an effort to identify the drivers of the growth. They examine how the in-flows and out-flows to and from self-employment have contributed to recent developments, and they present some evidence on the earnings of individuals moving between employment and self-employment in an effort to identify the nature of recent changes. A final section offers some discussion and conclusions.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Throughout this article, Q1 to Q4 will be used to refer to the first (January to March) to fourth (October to December) quarters of the calendar year.\n\n2. A person is self-employed if they run their business for themselves and take responsibility for its success or failure. Self-employment can be in the form of a sole trader, a partnership (two or more people who run a business) and an owner of a limited liability company (also responsible running the business). The split between full-time and part-time self-employment is based on respondents' self-classification.      \n","title":"Introduction"},{"markdown":"Both the number of self-employed workers and the share of all employment accounted for by self-employment have risen steadily over the past 15 years (Figures 1 and 2). The number of self-employed workers drifted gently downwards during the late 1990s, touching a low of 3.2 million in Q4 2000. However, it has grown fairly consistently since this low-point – punctuated by periods of strong growth in 2003 and 2014 – and as a result just, over 4.7 million workers were self-employed in early 2016. Around half of the growth in the absolute number of self-employed workers between 2001 and 2015 is accounted for by full-time self-employment, while the remainder is accounted for by growth in part-time self-employment. Between 2008 and 2015, the level of self-employment has risen by around 730,000 – again split evenly between the full-time and part-time modes.  \n\nAs the prevalence of total self-employment has risen more quickly than the number of employees, its share of all employment has also risen over this period: growing from close to 13.0% in 2008 to 14.9% in the most recent quarter (Figure 2). This recent rise is also largely consistent with the pre-downturn trend: the self-employment share has risen by around 3 percentage points since its low of 11.9% in 2000.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"d1c9235c\" />\n\nWhile the share of employment accounted for by self-employment has risen fairly consistently over the last 15 years, the ratio of self-employed hours to total hours has risen more slowly (Figure 2), providing a first clue about the nature of this development. Through much of the early 2000s, self-employment accounted for a much larger share of hours worked than employment. Over this period, the longer average hours worked by the self-employed ensured that their share of hours was around 0.8 to 1.1 percentage points higher than thier share of employment. However, the gap between these shares has gradually fallen and was eliminated almost entirely by 2014, reflecting the fall of average self-employed hours worked relative to the average for employees. \n\nFigure 3 examines this development in more detail, showing the change in the self-employment share of total employment accounted for by full- and part-time workers. Although the full- and part-time modes have accounted for similar fractions of the absolute change in self-employment, the number of part-time workers has grown much more quickly than the full-time mode. The number of part-time self-employed workers has risen by 88% between 2001 and 2015, compared with 25% for the full time mode. This faster growth has enlarged its share of total employment at the expense of other, slower-growing employment modes. Figure 3 indicates that between 2007 and 2015, the self-employment share increased by 1.6 percentage points, of which 1.2 percentage points were accounted for by part-time self-employment. Figure 3 shows that this is not only a recent phenomenon, but a longer-term trend. The part-time share has been rising consistently since the early 2000s, and accounts for the majority of the growth in the self-employment share over the last 15 years. The share of employment accounted for by full-time self-employment has grown relatively modestly, and accounts for a relatively small portion of the growth since the economic downturn.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"9c3e6f47\" />\n\nLong-term labour market changes – such as the growing prevalence of part-time self-employment – are often prompted by gradual demographic changes which have a small, but cumulative impact on labour market aggregates. The UK population has aged considerably over the last 15 years (ONS, 2016c), providing one such possible source of change. The average age of workers increased from 39 years to 41 years between 2001 and 2015, while the number of workers aged over 60 has grown from 1.5 million to 3.0 million over this period. If older workers are more likely to be self-employed, this gradual demographic drift can lead to movements in the headline number of self-employed workers, even in the absence of changes to the likelihood of workers in any given age group being self-employed. \n\nEstimating the precise impact of demographics is not straightforward, but while it appears that the ageing population has had an impact on the level of self-employment (Tatomir, 2015), this analysis finds that other factors are considerably more important. To quantify the impact of the ageing population, Figure 4 decomposes cumulative growth in self-employment relative to 2001 into the estimated contributions of changing demographics, participation and employment rates, as well as changes in the self-employment propensity of workers . It shows that while population growth and the ageing of the population have made a positive contribution to the growth of self-employment over recent years, it accounts for a relatively small fraction of the overall growth. Changes in participation – reflecting greater attachment to the labour market in 2015 than in 2001 – and changes in the propensity of individuals of different ages to be self-employed have a bigger impact. Consequently, while the ageing of the population appears to have had an important impact on total self-employment, much of its growth is due to changes in participation and self-employment propensity.\n\n <ons-chart path=\"cba21815\" />\n\nThese changes in self-employment propensity also appear to be relatively broadly based across different age groups – although some of the largest changes are among the oldest workers. Figure 5 estimates the self-employment share of employment of each age group in 2001 and 2015 (lines, right hand axis) and the change between the two periods (bars, left hand axis). The lines on this chart indicate that in both 2001 and 2015, self-employment accounted for a larger share of total employment at older ages – rising to almost half of all those in employment aged over 70. However, it also shows that the “self-employment propensity” of almost all age groups has risen over this period, with the largest changes among those aged over 70.\n\n<ons-image path=\"7ebbf4ea\" />\n\nThis change in self-employment propensity also appears to have been affected by a combination of stronger if volatile in-flows, and stable or weakening out-flows from self-employment. Figure 6 uses the Labour Force Survey (LFS) longitudinal datasets – which includes data from respondents aged 16 to 69 years old  – and presents data on worker movements into and out of self-employment from one quarter to the next, expressed as a proportion of all self-employed workers. It shows that much of the rise in self-employment in the post-downturn period can be attributed to somewhat stronger inflows than out-flows.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"fc371731\" />\n\n####Conclusions\n\nThe data in this section present several “stylised facts” about the recent rise in self-employment, which the following two sections examine in more detail. Firstly, the number of self-employed workers has risen rapidly over the last 15 years – reflecting a mixture of growth in the size of the population and growth in the propensity for workers to be self-employed. \n\nSecondly, the self-employment share of all employment has risen more quickly than its share of total hours worked, highlighting the importance of part-time self-employment in supporting recent trends. Although the part-time and full-time modes each account for around half of the absolute growth in the number of self-employed workers since 2001, the growth rate of the former group has been much faster. As a consequence, part-time self-employment accounts for more than half of the growth in the self-employment share of all employment since 2001, and closer to 75% of the growth observed since the onset of the economic downturn. \n\nThirdly, while demographic change – and in particular an ageing population – has been an important driver of self-employment, analysis suggests that worker choices about participation and the nature of their employment are considerably more important. Finally, the rise in self-employment appears largely a consequence of a rising, if volatile, inflow and a stable or falling outflow.  \n\n####Notes:\n\n1. This analysis sets out from the observation that the number of self-employed workers in a given period equals \n<ons-image path=\"782b5df8\" />\nwhere SE is total self-employment, P is the population, A is the economically active population, E is the number of people in employment and i and t index age groups and time periods respectively. This analysis uses discrete age groups between 18 and 79, and a composite for individuals aged 80 and above, uses annual frequency data and generates estimates for full- and part-time self-employment separately before aggregating to the totals displayed. The effects presented in the chart hold the ratios on the right hand side of [1] constant from 2001 sequentially. For instance, the impact of demographics is measured by holding the three right-hand side ratios constant at their 2001 levels and allowing the population age structure to evolve. The impact of participation rates is addressed by holding the final two ratios constant at their 2001 levels and allowing labour market participation to evolve. The final, ‘self-employment propensity’ effect is calculated by residual. Note that these effects may not be independent: the likelihood of participation may be affected by the relative attractiveness of self-employment, for example. These results are similar to those produced in a recent [Bank of England][1] analysis, which uses 2004 as its reference year. Here, for consistency with the rest of the piece, 2001 is the chosen reference year.\n\n2. Due to these sampling and other methodological differences, changes in the aggregate flows sourced from the longitudinal LFS may be different to changes measured in stock of self-employed workers (ONS, 2015a). \n\n\n  [1]: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2015/q105.pdf","title":"Headline trends in self-employment"},{"markdown":"Part-time self-employment accounted for around half of the absolute growth in the number of self-employed workers between 2001 and 2015. While the number of part-time employees has risen by 7.9% since the onset of the economic downturn in 2008, and the number of full-time self-employed workers has risen by 10.9%, the number of self-employed part-timers has risen by 46.6% over the same period. While it is tempting to ascribe this difference to the factors which surrounded the economic downturn, an examination of the longer-term series suggests that recent developments are better seen as a continuation of an existing, pre-downturn trend. Between 2001 and 2015, part-time self-employment grew by around 88% in total, while the number of employees working part-time grew by 25% in total.  \n\nAs a consequence of this strong growth in the number of part-time self-employed workers, its share of total employment and hours has risen over the 15 years between 2000 and 2015. Figure 7 shows that the employment share of part-time self-employment grew from around 2.6% in 2001 to 3.1% just before the downturn, before rising to around 4.3% in 2015. During the same period, the share of total hours worked by part-time self-employed workers increased by 0.8 percentage points. As it is this changing prevalence of part-time self-employment which accounts for much of the growth in the aggregate self-employment share over this period, understanding developments in part-time self-employment are key to understanding this feature of recent labour market behaviour.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"731aeecc\" />\n\n####Who are the part-time self-employed?\n\nOne approach to understanding changes in this part of the UK’s labour market is to examine how the characteristics of the part-time self-employed have varied through time. This approach uses the repeated snap-shots of data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) to understand the starting composition of the group, as well as how it has developed over time. Figures 8 to 14 present some of these key characteristics and how they have developed between 2001 and 2015 – encapsulating both the sustained long-term growth in part-time self-employment and the growth observed during the economic recovery. \n\nPerhaps the most natural starting point is the age and sex mix of the part-time self-employed, which differs markedly from that of part-time employees. The ratio of female to male workers in the former group (Figure 8) was around 3:2 in 2015 – considerably more balanced than among part-time employees (3:1 in the same period). The composition of both these groups is marked by the larger number of female workers who opt to work part-time, likely reflecting household choices about labour supply (Craig, et al., 2012). However, both part-time employees and self-employed workers have become more gender balanced over the last 15 years, as the share of female workers in both groups contracted slightly between 2001 (points) and 2015 (bars), with a corresponding uplift in the share of men working part-time over the period.\n\n<ons-image path=\"8333cbd2\" />\n\nThe age profile of part-time self-employed workers reveals that they tend to be older than part-time employees. Figure 9 plots the age distribution for part-time self-employment (blue lines) and part-time employees (red lines) – showing the proportions of each group which are composed of workers of specific ages. Among employees, the age distribution in 2015 was bimodal, with a concentration among younger workers around 20 year olds, likely composed of students and early-career workers. The second concentration lies among workers in their mid-40s, this second mass occurs later and is less pronounced than in 2001. Among self-employed workers, the distribution also appears to have two, broad concentrations – with a mass around workers in their mid-40s, and another around 60 to 65. The distributions for both cohorts relative to 2001 show a general shift towards older aged workers, but this shift is more striking among part-time self-employed workers. The 65 plus age group accounted for 22% of all part-time self-employment in 2015, up from 14% in 2001.\n\n<ons-image path=\"6bb668a5\" />\n\nCombining these two characteristics – age and sex – reveals that the part-time self-employed are composed of several different groups whose attraction to this mode of working are likely to vary. In 2001, the part-time self-employed population was broadly a combination of older men and a mixture of younger and mid-aged women (Figure 10, Panel A). This may reflect the choices of women with families to work in a more flexible way, and a choice among older men to delay retirement through self-employment. Comparing the equivalent distributions of part-time self-employment in 2015 with this 2001 baseline suggests that the growing prevalence of this mode of working is particularly due to a larger number of part-time self-employed older men and women (see Figure 10, Panel B), as well as to growth among younger and mid-aged women. While younger and mid-aged men have also made a contribution to the growth in part-time self-employment, this effect appears relatively modest next to the contribution of older workers and younger and mid-aged women.\n\n<ons-image path=\"6244cf83\" />\n\nWhile these trends partly reflect the demographic structure of the UK population – and in particular the larger number of older workers – there is also evidence that the “part-time self-employed propensity” has risen over this period. Figure 11 shows this propensity for men, women and all workers (Panels A, B and C respectively) in 2001 and 2015, as well as the difference between the two observation points. These data suggest that part-time self-employment is more prevalent among older workers, and that it has become more prevalent across most age groups over the last 15 years. As with total self-employment, some of the largest changes over the last 15 years are among the oldest workers: among older female workers in particular – who were more likely to be part-time self-employed than younger workers in 2001 – the self-employment propensity has risen.\n\n<ons-image path=\"de6e470c\" />\n\nThe growing number of part-time self-employed workers has come alongside growth in the average length of the usual working week for this group. Figure 12 shows the distribution of usual hours worked by part-time self-employed workers and employees in 2001 and 2015. For both groups, the distribution of usual hours has shifted slightly higher since 2001 although, on average, the part-time self-employed tend to work fewer hours than part-time employees. This partly reflects the age-mix of the part-time self-employed. Older workers – defined as those aged 60 and above – tend to work shorter part-time weeks than younger part-time self-employed workers, and the behaviour of the latter group is much closer to employees of a comparable age.\n\n<ons-image path=\"9c644305\" />\n\nChanges in the usual working patterns of part-time self-employed workers may also reflect the evolving mix of industries in which they work. Figure 13 shows the share of part-time self-employed workers and part-time employees by industry in 2001 (crosses) and 2015 (bars). It indicates that part-time self-employed workers are concentrated in the finance & business activities industries, whereas part-time employees are predominately in the wholesale, retail & motor trade, and health & social work industries. Part-time self-employed workers have also become more concentrated in the education and finance & business services industries over the last 15 years, shifting away from health & social work and wholesale & retail trade. There are some marked differences between the industries of part-time employees and self-employed workers.\n\n<ons-image path=\"b572fc4b\" />\n\nAlongside these differences in industrial mix, there are also clear differences in the occupational structure and job-tenure of part-time self-employed workers relative to part-time employees. Part-time self-employed workers are more concentrated in higher occupational groups, and although part-time employees have risen in occupational stature since 2001, there is little change for the part-time self-employed. Figure 14 shows the share of self-employed and employee part-timers by job tenure. It indicates that over the last 15 years, part-time self-employed workers are also more likely to have been in their job for a longer period of time than their employee counterparts.\n\n<ons-image path=\"abdecef1\" />\n\nFinally, there are also differences in the regional spread of part-time self-employed workers. Part-time self-employed workers are relatively concentrated in the South East, London and the South West. These regions account for close to half of the part-time self-employed population: however, this pattern broadly follows the distribution of part-time employees – albeit slightly more concentrated in London and the South East. The share of part-time self-employed individuals in all regions has also changed very little since 2001, suggesting that other determinants are more important in explaining the growth of part-time self-employment.\n\nTaken together, these data suggest that as a group the part-time self-employed have become older over the last 15 years, reflecting the growing popularity of this employment mode among older men and women and a group of younger and mid-aged women in particular. They suggest that the part-time self-employed are relatively concentrated in finance & business services – and that this concentration has risen over the last 15 years – that they tend to be in higher occupational positions, and that they have held their job for a relatively long period of time. Finally, consistent with changes in average part-time hours, the distribution of average usual weekly part-time self-employed hours has shifted up over the last 15 years, but remains below that of part-time employees.  \n\n####Motivations for part-time self-employment\n\nWhile changes in cross-sectional characteristics provide some clues about the reasons for the recent growth in part-time self-employment, it is difficult to establish precise causes with any certainty. This section steps beyond these characteristics by using a range of questions posed as part of the Labour Force Survey (LFS) to examine whether the part-time self-employed are broadly content with their employment mode. This analysis provides some information about the nature of the recent growth in self-employment. \n\nAddressing the question of whether part-time self-employed workers are content with their mode of employment is critical to recent debates about whether recent developments in the labour market are structural or cyclical, and provides insights about whether the mode is a form of \"disguised unemployment\". It can be approached from three different angles using questions directed to respondents in the LFS. Firstly, data from the LFS indicates that the vast majority of the part-time self-employed chose to work part-time because they did not want a full-time job. While the question posed here is backward looking – asking why a respondent took a part-time position, rather than why they are currently working part-time – the results provide a partial window on the choices of these workers. Panel A of Figure 15 uses the approach adopted above to divide respondents by age group and sex, and shows the reasons for part-time working provided by each group. A majority of part-time self-employed women of every age in 2015 report \"not wanting a full-time job\" as their reason for working part-time. Among men aged 55 and above, the part-time mode also appears to be the preferred option, with the fraction providing other reasons falling away to zero from those aged above 65. For these groups, this evidence suggests that part-time employment is preferred to a full-time role. \n\nAmong younger men – in particular those aged 25 to 34 – the evidence is more mixed. While among young women, the part-time option also appears to be a preference, among mid-aged and younger part-time self-employed men the \"optimality\" of their mode of employment is uncertain. For these workers, a large portion of the respondents suggest that they would prefer to work longer hours.\n\n<ons-image path=\"4f33a2dc\" />\n\nHow have these data changed through time? Panel B of Figure 15 shows the growth of part-time self-employment by age, sex and the reason for working part-time between 2001 and 2015. As reported above, most of the growth of part-time self-employment has been among older workers, as well as some growth among women in their 40s and 50s. Panel B also suggests that among these groups, growth has been supported by growth in the fraction of people who report that they do not want a full-time position. Among mid-aged and younger men, however, most of the growth in part-time self-employment since 2001 has been accompanied by growth in the number of workers reporting that they cannot find a full-time position. \n\nCombining these age and sex groups, Figure 16 highlights this point by showing the percentage change in part-time self-employment between 2001 and 2015, as well as the contributions from the reason for working part-time. It indicates that the majority of growth has been due to changes in the fraction who preferred a part-time position, with a smaller, if still substantial rise in those who could not find a full-time post.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"254ab6d1\" />\n\nThe second way of approaching the ‘optimality’ of the part-time self-employment choice is to examine whether workers are \"happily self-employed\". The LFS recently introduced a question asking respondents why they chose this mode of employment, offering several possible pre-determined reasons. As before, this question is backwards looking – asking why respondents became self-employed – and its limited history reduces the potential for analysis through time. However, it does provide some sense of the reasons workers became self-employed (Department for Business, Innovation & Skills, 2016a). To draw some broad conclusions, Figure 17 aggregates these reasons into four subjectively defined groups: (a) broadly \"positive\" reasons (including making a choice about the nature of work desired or the identification of a niche in the marketplace), (b) \"negative\" reasons (including redundancy and not being able to find alternative employment), (c) \"life-style choice\" reasons (including to boost household income and as a form of working after retirement) and (d) broadly \"neutral\" reasons (including starting or joining a family business, or other reason).\n\n<ons-chart path=\"0a6d3cfe\" />\n\nThe results from this analysis are difficult to interpret. Among the few conclusions which can be drawn confidently, these data suggest that the vast majority of part-time self-employed workers do not report negative reasons for their employment choice. Where negative reasons are reported – among older workers – this group accounts for a relatively small share, and is outweighed by the relatively narrowly defined ‘positive’ reasons – which are also concentrated among older workers. Among older workers, part-time self-employment also appears to have been used as a means of extending work beyond retirement and of supporting household income. However, it is difficult to establish workers’ motivations with any certainty as it is unclear whether these choices were driven by financial necessity and distress, or by a more positive choice. Among younger workers, the limited number of respondents also contributes to make it difficult to draw firm conclusions.\n\nThirdly, while questions on whether individuals are \"happily part-time\" or \"happily self-employed\" assess individual’s attitudes towards specific aspects of their labour market position, their degree of dissatisfaction might also be approximated by the fraction of individuals seeking alternative employment. Figure 18 shows how the part-time self-employed share of all employment has changed relative to 2007, including contributions from among workers who are, and who are not, seeking alternative employment. It indicates that the number of workers looking for another job grew following the economic downturn. However, this only accounted for a small proportion of this increase in part-time self-employment share: the majority of the increase has been among those who are not seeking a different job.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"d8302063\" />\n\n####Analysis of part-time self-employment flows\n\nThe final part of the analysis of trends in part-time self-employment uses the LFS longitudinal datasets, which track the detailed employment transitions of individuals over a period of 5 quarters. In contrast to the cross-sectional data presented above, these longitudinal data permit analysis of the labour market status of workers before they become part-time self-employed, as well as their employment choices after they leave. \n\nMuch of the growth in part-time self-employment appears to have been a consequence of a higher, if more volatile, inflow, and a relatively stable outflow. Figure 19, which shows the gross in-flows and outflows as a proportion of all in self-employment, indicates that the numbers of people entering and leaving part-time self-employment in each rolling 4-quarter period was close to 5% in 2015. It also shows that the gross inflow has exceeded the gross outflow in each quarter of the last 17 years, except in Q1 2009, although the difference between them broadened considerably between 2009 and 2014.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"7e8df7a1\" />\n\nCombining these aggregate gross flows with information about the source and destination of individuals permits an analysis of the net flow into part-time self-employment from other labour market positions. Figure 20 shows contributions to the net flow into part-time self-employment from unemployment, inactivity, full-time self-employment and employees. Where a component makes a positive contribution to the net flow – such as the consistent, positive contribution from unemployment – Figure 20 implies that more individuals moved into part-time self-employment from that status than left part-time self-employment to join it. \n\nRead in this way, it is clear that the long-term growth of part-time self-employment is largely a consequence of the net inflows from unemployment, employment and full-time self-employment consistently exceeding the net outflow to inactivity. The source of the sharp rise in the net inflow following the economic downturn is also somewhat clearer. During this period, the net inflows from full-time self-employment and unemployment increased relatively sharply, while the net inflow from inactivity – which had persistently dragged on the growth of part-time self-employment during the decade prior to 2000 – shrank and became slightly positive. This latter result is particularly striking given the ageing of the part-time self-employed population. All else equal, a greater flow to inactivity might be expected from a relatively older group of workers: the opposite of what is observed.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"acc1deb4\" />\n\nWhile it is not possible to be sure of precise causes, these data are broadly consistent with three conjectures. Firstly, following the economic downturn a large number of full-time self-employed individuals either chose to become part-time, or found that meeting demand for their services no longer required full-time input. As a result, many of these workers shifted from a full-time mode to a part-time mode, but otherwise continued with their business. To explore the precise nature of these transitions, Figure 21 shows heat maps of the occupation (Panel A) and the industry (Panel B) of those full-time self-employed who transitioned to part-time self-employment between 2010 and 2015. On the vertical (horizontal) axis is plotted their occupation or industry before (after) transition, and the brighter colours indicate larger numbers. The concentration of workers along the diagonal – suggesting that individuals shifting from full-time to part-time self-employment change their occupation or industry relatively rarely – is indicative that these workers continued with broadly the same activities, but simply cut their hours.\n\n<ons-image path=\"a4b249b8\" />\n\nTransitions from full-time to part-time self-employment also appear to be most prevalent among relatively older workers, suggesting that it is relatively experienced workers who make this move. Figure 22 reports the likelihood of a worker of a given age transitioning from full-time to part-time self-employment relative to workers aged 30 to 32, drawn from a regression-model with controls for other individual and time-period characteristics. It suggests that relative to a full-time self-employed worker in their early 30s, an equivalent individual aged in their late 50s and 60s is between 5% and 20% more likely to make the transition to part-time self-employment, suggesting that these moves are partly about managing the transition from employment to inactivity.\n\n<ons-image path=\"50b24235\" />\n\nA second conjecture which is consistent with these flows data is that part-time self-employment proved a relatively more attractive form of employment for some workers who found themselves unemployed during the economic downturn. Examining the gross flows, there is some evidence that the initial downturn was associated with more self-employed part-timers becoming unemployed. By mid-2010, however, this flow has broadly returned to its pre-downturn rate, and the flow from unemployment to part-time self-employment has picked up. \n\nThere is also some evidence that these transitions from unemployment to part-time self-employment were more likely among those who had been out of work for a relatively short period. Figure 23 shows the impact of several unemployment durations on the likelihood of making this transition, conditional on several individual characteristics. It suggests that workers who had beeen out of work for less than two years had broadly the same likelihood of transitioning to part-time self-employment, but that at longer-durations the probability of moving to part-time self-employment was significantly lower.\n\n<ons-image path=\"701bde75\" />\n\nExamining the net flow from unemployment to part-time self-employment in more detail also suggests that the recent strength of this flow is due to relatively young workers. Figure 24 compares the net flows from unemployment to part-time self-employment by age group between 2002 and 2007 with the net flow between 2010 and 2015. The net flow from unemployment to part-time self-employment among workers aged 65 and over was virtually zero in both periods, but all other age groups show some growth over this time-frame. Among 16 to 24 year olds and among 35 to 44 year olds and the increase is particularly pronounced. The former flow rises from 5,300 to 16,100 over this period, with the latter increased from a net flow of 7,900 to 22,500 over this period. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"d98d216a\" />\n\nThe third conjecture which is consistent with the net flows data is that relatively older workers who were part-time self-employed chose to continue working rather than retiring during the economic downturn. This can be seen in Figure 20 above, in which the consistent net outflow from part-time self-employment to inactivity declines to zero following the economic downturn, and even adds to the stock of self-employed part-timers in 2011 and 2013. This development is largely a consequence of a continued increase in the inflow from inactivity, and a broadly flat profile for the out-flow. Given the ageing of the part-time self-employed, this result is particularly noteworthy. \n\nFinally, the longitudinal LFS data also permit some analysis of the earnings of employees moving into or from part-time self-employment. While measures of hourly self-employment income are not available from the LFS – in one of several areas where the measurement of income is particularly difficult (Department for Business, Innovation & Skills, 2016b) – it is possible to identify (a) the hourly earnings of employees prior to their move into self-employment, as well as (b) the hourly earnings of those moving from part-time self-employment into an employee job after their move. If earnings are a broad proxy for the skill, capability and productivity of an individual, then this approach permits the use of the broadly defined ‘quality’ of labour moving into or from part-time self-employment. While these results do not necessarily generalise – in particular, inferences cannot be drawn about the earnings of the part-time self-employed as a whole, and cannot account for short-run dynamics which might prompt individuals to change their labour market status  – they are suggestive of the broad quality of labour involved in these movements.\n\nThis analysis suggests that in general, employees moving into part-time self-employment tend to earn more before making the transition than employees who transition to a new part-time employee job in the same time period. Figure 25 shows pre-transition median hourly earnings for those who move to new part-time self-employment and part-time employee positions each period between 2004 and 2015. In these years, it appears that individuals transitioning to new part-time self-employed positions earned relatively more than individuals transitioning to new part-time employee positions. To the extent that these data capture the quality of labour flowing to part-time employee and self-employed positions, they suggest that in most periods the workers entering part-time self-employment are relatively skilled or experienced, allowing them to command higher earnings.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"27694b28\" />\n\nA similar analysis can be conducted for workers who are leaving part-time self-employment. Figure 26 plots the post-move median hourly earnings for individuals who (a) move from part-time self-employment to an employee position, and (b) the earnings of individuals who move from one employee job to another. These estimates are more similar than those for the in-flow into part-time self-employment, but equally suggest that the flow of labour out of the part-time self-employed can command higher earnings as employees than individuals leaving part-time employee positions in the same period. This effect is particularly marked in 2009, 2010 and 2013 – periods in which new-starting employees who were previously self-employed earned considerably more than those who were previously employees. This may reflect a self-selection process in the choice to transition to new employee positions – in which only quite experienced self-employed workers moved to new employee positions during periods of labour market disquiet.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"96c2694e\" />\n\n####Conclusion\n\nThis section has set out (a) the characteristics of the part-time self-employed, (b) how these characteristics have changed over the past 15 years and (c) some analysis of their satisfaction with and motivation for being part-time self-employed. It has (d) analysed the gross in-flow to, out-flow from and net flow to part-time self-employment, and provides (e) some descriptive work examining the quality of labour – as proxied by earnings – which has transitioned to and from part-time self-employment in recent years. \n\nThe data presented here indicate that part-time self-employment accounts for a large fraction of the growth in both the absolute number of self-employed workers, and the self-employment share of all employment over the last 15 years. This analysis suggests that the part-time self-employed are a relatively diverse group with differing aims and objectives. In particular, part-time self-employment appears to have become a positive choice for older workers who are apparently managing their transition out of the workforce. Although there is evidence of this process being underway from the early 2000s, the economic downturn in 2008 appears to have strengthened this trend. A large number of these older workers are similarly content to work part-time and be self-employed, and very few are seeking alternative work. In sum, the data presented here make it difficult – although not impossible – to characterise these older workers as suffering from a form of \"disguised unemployment\". \n\nFor other age groups and for younger men in particular, the picture is a good deal less clear. Among these workers there is more evidence of dissatisfaction with their labour market status, with a larger fraction reporting that they would prefer not to be part-time. A larger portion of these workers also appear to have moved directly from unemployment into part-time self-employment – which may be an indication of a choice made under difficult circumstances. However, this group has made a relatively modest contribution to the growth of part-time self-employment over recent years. Among younger women – who have made a larger contribution – the evidence is consistent with this group making a relatively positive choice about their employment mode. The precise reasons for this are difficult to establish, but it seems likely that the relative flexibility of part-time self-employment may play an important role.\n\n\n####Notes:\n\n1.   For instance, workers may choose to become part-time self-employed on account of a recent fall in earnings which makes their economic position materially worse, or they may choose to become employees because their earnings potential is significantly greater within a corporate entity than running their own. In both cases, the ‘quality’ of labour transitioning to or from part-time self-employment would be understated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"Trends in part-time self-employment"},{"markdown":"Full-time self-employment accounted for around 78% of total self-employment in 2001, or around 2.6 million workers. Over the last 15 years, this number has increased by around 25% to 3.2 million, and as a result, full-time self-employment accounted for around half of the absolute growth in aggregate self-employment over this period. However, a large portion of this growth is explained by changes in the aggregate number of workers in the population. Full-time self-employment accounted for 9.2% of total employment in 2001 and on this basis has been fairly stable over the last 15 years. It increased steeply to 9.9% in 2004, before stabilising at around 10% for the 9 years between 2004 and 2013 (Figure 27). A further steep rise in 2014 has left the employment share of self-employment at 10.5% in Q1 2016, around 1.3 percentage points higher than 15 years earlier.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"2f93859b\" />\n\nTotal hours worked by the full-time self-employed have broadly followed the trend set by the full-time self-employment share over this period. Unlike part-time self-employment – whose share of employment exceeds its share of hours worked – full-time self-employment accounts for a larger portion of hours than of employment as a consequence of the longer average hours of this group. The gap between these two shares of between 2.5 and 3.0 percentage points has also been fairly stable over this period, indicating that the trend in average hours worked has broadly followed average hours worked as a whole.\n\n####Who are the full-time self-employed?\n\nFull-time self-employment is composed of a much larger fraction of male workers than either full-time employees or the part-time self-employed (Figure 28). The ratio of male to female workers was approximately 2:1 for full-time employees in 2001, and around 2:3 for part-time self-employment, while the same ratio for full-time self-employment was closer to 4:1 in the same period. These ratios moderated slightly by 2015, although full-time self-employment remains highly skewed towards men.\n\n<ons-image path=\"bbab9873\" />\n\nThe age profile for full-time self-employment suggests that this group is considerably older on average than full-time employment (Figure 29). Up to the mid-30s, the density of full-time employees was greater than the density of full-time self-employment in 2015, after which the effects switch around; Workers above this age account for a larger share of the full-time self-employed than the share of full-time employees. Between 2001 and 2015, both distributions have shifted to the right, indicating an ageing of both groups. While the story is less clear than among the part-time self-employed, the mass of the full-time self-employed distribution has clearly shifted from workers between 30 and 45 towards those aged 50 and above. Some portion of this ageing appears to have taken place during the recent economic recovery. The fraction of full-time self-employed workers aged 65 and above increased markedly around 2010 and has continued to grow. Conversely, the middle aged category (35-44) of full-time self-employed workers has followed a downward trend, declining following the economic downturn.\n\n<ons-image path=\"9fd8f5a3\" />\n\nWhile these trends are suggestive, combining the age and sex mix of the full-time self-employed workers is less revealing about the nature of full-time self-employment than the equivalent part-time self-employment picture (Figure 30, Panel A, vs Figure 10, Panel A). The dominance of males is clear, but the age distributions of men and women in 2001 are fairly well matched. Self-employment appears to peak for both groups at a broadly similar age – among workers in between their mid-30s and mid-50s. By 2015, the distribution has shifted slightly towards older age groups for both men and women (Figure 30, Panel B).\n\n<ons-image path=\"93999f8c\" />\n\nWhile these developments partly reflect changes in the age and sex structure of the UK’s working population, there is also some evidence of a shift in the full-time self-employment propensity of different age groups. Figure 31 – which parallels Figure 11 – suggests that the propensity of people to be full-time self-employed tends to grow with age, with both the 2001 and 2015 profiles rising with the age of respondents. Among men, the ratio of full-time self-employment to total employment in 2015 is slightly higher than in 2001 among workers aged up to 30, and varies relatively little between the ages of 30 and 50. However, among older male workers, the prevalence of full-time self-employment appears to have varied considerably over this period. Among women, while the profile in 2015 is broadly similar to that in 2001, it is higher across all age groups, and particularly so among the oldest workers.\n\n<ons-image path=\"734f5a82\" />\n\nThe aggregate labour supply provided by the growing number of full-time self-employed workers is amplified by the relatively long average usual hours that these workers report. While the majority of full-time self-employed workers and full-time employees have usual working weeks of between 35 and 45 hours, a larger fraction of the full-time self-employed work longer weeks of between 50 and 70 hours (Figure 32). Between 2001 and 2015 these differences have narrowed slightly: the length of the working week for full-time employees has shifted leftwards marginally, while the density of full-time self-employed working less than 50 hours has increased at the expense of those working weeks of more than 50 hours. The reason for the longer average working weeks of full-time self-employed workers is difficult to establish, with the pattern cutting across workers in different industries and occupations, by age and sex.\n\n<ons-image path=\"74297939\" />\n\nThe regional concentration of the full-time self-employed also broadly reflects the regional pattern of full-time employees (Figure 33). Around a third of full-time self-employed workers are located in the South East and London. The share of full-time self-employed accounted for by London has risen from 14.6% to 17.0% between 2001 and 2015. The share of full-time self-employment accounted for by Yorkshire and Humberside has also risen over this period, with corresponding falls in other regions – in particular in Scotland and the North West.\n\n<ons-image path=\"feadd588\" />\n\nThe industrial composition of the full-time self-employed also suggests that, while there has been relatively little change in the aggregate number of these workers, there has been a reallocation of workers between industries (Figure 34). In 2001, the full-time self-employed were concentrated in the construction, financial & business services and wholesale, retail & motor trade industries, which accounted for almost 60% of all of these workers. By 2015, the fraction in finance & business services had grown considerably while the fraction accounted for by construction was little changed. As a result, most other industries saw their shares fall, with a particularly large fall in the wholesale, retail & motor trade industry.\n\n<ons-image path=\"d65a1468\" />\n\nFinally, the full-time self-employed are relatively more concentrated in skilled trades occupations compared with full-time employees (Figure 35). A majority of the full-time self-employed were skilled trades people (30%) or reported being in managerial occupations (20%) in 2015, likely reflecting the nature of their work, their position as businesses owners and their relatively long job-tenure. Markedly fewer full-time self-employed workers are in administrative roles, elementary occupations or sales and customer services occupations. These characteristics are broadly unchanged on the position in 2001.\n\n<ons-image path=\"c1d46b84\" />\n\nIn summary, this section has shown that number of full-time self-employed workers increased considerably between 2001 and 2015 – accounting for around half the growth in the absolute number of self-employed. However, as this growth rate is relatively close to that of employment as a whole, the full-time self-employed have accounted for a large, relatively stable proportion of total employment over this period. As group, there are many more male than female full-time self-employed workers, and the age composition has got older in recent years. Part of the explanation for this effect appears to have come through demographics, as the ageing population means that there are simply more relatively old workers in the labour market. However, there is also evidence of a rising full-time self-employment propensity among female workers of all ages, younger male workers and older workers of both sexes. While the employment share of full-time self-employment has been relatively stable in recent years, there is also some evidence of reallocation between industries and regions. These workers remain relatively concentrated in the construction trade, but are increasingly specialised in financial & business services. Geographically, a larger portion of them are in London than in 2001, while they remain concentrated in skilled trades occupations, in positions they have occupied – on average – for longer than the representative full-time employee. \n\n####Changes in motivation for self-employment\n\nAs with part-time self-employment, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) cross-sectional data permit an examination of the extent to which these workers are satisfied with their self-employed status, as well as changes in their job-seeking behaviour. Both of these metrics could permit a greater degree of confidence about the long-term sustainability of the current level of full-time self-employment: if recent growth in this employment mode has been associated with rising levels of worker dissatisfaction, then as the economy continues to recover these workers might be drawn into other forms of employment. By contrast, if workers appear to be relatively satisfied as full-time self-employed workers, then it seems likely that the choice is made on a more positive basis, or at least is serving workers’ objectives. \n\nFigure 36 shows the decomposition of full-time self-employment by age and the reason given for a worker choosing to be self-employed in 2015. Similarly to the analysis in Figure 17 above, this question on the LFS asks why a worker chose to become self-employed – not why they are currently self-employed – and has only been included in the survey for a short period. This limits the analysis that can be conducted and the confidence that can be attached to the results. Among the clearest findings in Figure 36 is that while some workers of all ages report negative reasons for becoming self-employed, they were a minority in each group in 2015. Instead, a majority report positive or neutral reasons for choosing self-employment at every age group.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"4789b95b\" />\n\nThis absence of a large group of dissatisfied full-time self-employed workers is reflected in their job-seeking behaviour. Figure 37 shows the change in the employment share of full-time self-employment since 2007, as well as contributions to it from those either seeking or not seeking alternative employment. While the changes in the employment share for full-time self-employed workers are more modest than among part-time self-employment, the overall trend is similar: a relatively small proportion of the growth in full-time self-employment can be explained by growing numbers of workers who are seeking alternative jobs.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"a4571610\" />\n\n####Analysis of full-time self-employment flows\n\nFinally, the longitudinal LFS datasets permit the analysis of flows into and from full-time self-employment, enabling researchers to identify where the inflow of workers arrives from, and to where the outflow is directed. Figure 38 plots the gross in-flow to and out-flow from full-time self-employment since 1999 among workers aged 16-69. It shows that among workers of these ages, the gross in-flows and out-flows have been relatively closely matched over this period, albeit with specific periods of divergence between 2008 and 2012 in particular. Over the period as a whole, Figure 38 suggests that there has been a modest net outflow from full-time self-employment among workers aged 16 to 69 – in contrast to the movement of the headline data. This difference between the net flow and the change in the stock is well known and due to differences in methodology, weighting and coverage. In particular, the longitudinal datasets exclude workers aged over 70 – which may have been particularly important for recent changes in full-time self-employment –helping to give rise to this discrepancy. Clearly, this constraint places limits on the conclusions that can be drawn for the full-time self-employed as a whole. \n\nFocussing on the majority of full-time self-employment which is aged between 16 and 69, changes in full-time self-employment also appear to have been driven by movements in the outflow: while the inflow has risen gradually over the last few years, variation in the outflow has been considerable. Immediately following the economic downturn, the gross outflow increased considerably - largely as a consequence of a substantial number of full-time self-employed workers moving into unemployment. Of the almost 1.5 percentage point increase in the outflow, almost half is accounted for by changes in the gross outflow to unemployment. During the economic recovery which followed, the outflow moderated as the flow of full-time self-employed workers becoming unemployed returned to broadly its pre-downturn rate. Instead, the outflow was supported by a gross outflow from full-time to part-time self-employment.\n\n <ons-chart path=\"e82e8be7\" />\n\nFigure 39 examines the net-flows implied by these data. It shows contributions to the net flow into this mode of employment arising in the net movements from unemployment, employment and inactivity, paralleling Figure 20. It indicates that the steady net outflow over this period is a result of the net flows to inactivity and part-time self-employment exceeding the more modest net inflows from employment and unemployment – and of these the movement from employment is usually large relative to the movement from unemployment. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"ec7b148e\" />\n\nThe clearest change in the net inflow to full-time self-employment occurred during the economic downturn, when flows from a range of different statuses changed. The usually positive flow of employees into full-time self-employment appears to have dried up over this period – possibly indicating the risk aversion of workers in the face of uncertainty about future demand – and growth in the number of full-time self-employed becoming unemployed more than offset the growing inflow from unemployment. \n\nDuring more recent times, the recovery in the net flow has been a consequence of three developments. Firstly, employees started to move into full-time self-employment again in 2010 and 2011. Then following a brief fall, this flow has been larger in the last two years than at any point since 1999. Secondly and offsetting this development, the increased rate of churn between full-time and part-time self-employment has taken a considerable length of time to settle down following the downturn. Although it has now broadly returned to its pre-downturn rate, the net-outflow to part-time self-employment has held down the growth of this status in recent years. Thirdly, changes in the flow to inactivity have had a considerable bearing on the overall net inflow during this period – possibly reflecting the unwinding of deferred retirement during the economic downturn itself.  \n\nAs with part-time self-employment, the longitudinal flows data also provide a means of examining the earnings of workers moving to and from full-time self-employment as a broad proxy for the skills, experience and earnings potential of this group. While inferences cannot be drawn about the earnings of the full-time self-employed as a whole, the results of these analyses can be instructive. Figure 40 shows the pre-transition median hourly earnings for (a) employees who move to a new full-time self-employed position within a year and (b) employees who move to a new employee position over the same time period. In the pre-downturn period, median hourly earnings for those moving to full-time self-employment were slightly higher but broadly comparable to that of individuals moving to new employee positions. However, with the exception of 2011, there is some evidence that higher earners continued to move into full-time self-employment – possibly capturing the willingness of more capable workers to take the risk of changing employment status during the downturn. This effect appears to have been reversed in 2014 and 2015 – with the two distributions moving back together. With the exception of this downturn period, the longitudinal data on earnings prior to transition for full-time self-employment suggest that – to the extent that earnings capture information about the quality of labour – the flow into full-time self-employment from employment is of a broadly similar calibre to those starting a new employee position.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"a0f64fc2\" />\n\nFinally, Figure 41 shows similar median hourly earnings measures for the post-transition earnings of workers moving from full-time self-employment and full-time employee positions to new employee positions. They suggest that – consistent with the analysis above – these two groups of workers can command broadly similar earnings as employees, indicating that the quality of labour leaving full-time self-employment is similar to the quality of employee leavers in the same period.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"5eddc9f1\" />\n\n####Conclusions \n\nThis section has set out (a) the characteristics of the full-time self-employed, (b) how these characteristics have changed over the past 15 years and (c) some analysis of their satisfaction with their labour market status. It has (d) analysed the gross inflow to, outflow from and net flow to full-time self-employment, and examines (e) the earnings of workers who have transitioned to and from full-time self-employment in recent years as a proxy for the broad ‘quality’ of the labour supplied. \n\nThe data presented in this section suggest that full-time self-employment grew considerably over the 2001 to 2015 period – accounting for close to half the absolute growth in total self-employment. However, as much of this growth is accounted for by growing number in employment, its share of total employment has been relatively stable over this period. Alongside these developments, there is some evidence that full-time self-employed workers have shifted in their composition over this period. As a group, the full-time self-employed are composed of more workers who are older and of slightly more female workers in 2015 than in 2001 – although males continue to dominate this form of employment. There is some evidence that they have shifted away from some traditional forms of self-employment – in particular in the wholesale, retail & motor trades industry – and towards finance & business services, although construction remains as important to this group in 2015 as it was in 2001. The full-time self-employed work relatively long hours – giving them a larger share of hours worked than employment – and are now more concentrated in London than in previous years. \n\nThese results also suggest that a majority of the full-time self-employed are broadly content with their labour market status. While some workers of all ages report negative reasons for being self-employment, a majority report either positive or neutral reasons for their choice and the degree of reported job-seeking behaviour is very small and little changed on its level in 2001, or compared with the pre-downturn period.\n\nAnalysis of the longitudinal data on full-time self-employment provide further evidence that, while the employment share of this group has changed relatively little over the last 15 years, there are some complex dynamics taking place under the surface. Among the clearest of these results is that full-time self-employment usually benefits from a net inflow from employees and from unemployment – although both of these flows were reversed during the economic downturn. Among workers aged 16 to 69, this inflow has been balanced by a larger net outflow to part-time self-employment and – more recently – to inactivity. The flows data also suggest that the earnings potential of workers joining the ranks of the full-time self-employed and those moving out of this status is broadly similar to employees starting new positions in the same time period. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"Trends in full-time self-employment"},{"markdown":"The performance of the labour market and growth of self-employment have been among the defining characteristics of the UK’s recent economic recovery. The headline employment rate – which fell from 73.0% in Q1 2008 to 70.1% in Q3 2011 – recovered relatively quickly, aided in part by strong growth in self-employment. By Q1 2016, the employment rate had risen to a record high of 74.2%, and just over 4.5 million workers were self-employed. This growth, the strength of employment relative to output and the resulting weakness of labour productivity pose a particular challenge to our understanding of the UK labour market. This paper examines the rise in self-employment through a range of official statistics with the aim of unpacking some of the key drivers of this phenomenon. \n\nTaking the 2008 to 2015 period as a whole, the level of self-employment increased by around 730,000: from 3.8 million to 4.5 million. Of this increase, around half was accounted for by full-time self-employment, and around half was accounted for by part-time self-employment. While it is tempting to ascribe this development to the circumstances of the economic downturn and recovery – and it may have played a part – this paper finds that these trends are better seen as a continuation of an existing, pre-downturn trend. Taking the 2001 to 2015 period as a whole -when the level of self-employment increased from 3.2 million to 4.5 million – roughly half of the increase was accounted for by full-time, and around half by part-time self-employment. \n\nSecondly, this paper finds that part-time self-employment has played an important role in raising the prevalence of self-employment as a whole. The number of workers in this mode of employment grew by 88% between 2001 and 2015 – compared with 25% for full-time self-employment. As a result, part-time self-employment accounts for 1.2 percentage points of the 1.6 percentage point increase in the share of all employment accounted for by self-employment between 2008 and 2015. While full-time self-employment continues to account for the majority of self-employed workers, but with the exception of a few, specific periods – in 2003 and 2014 in particular – its share of employment and hours has relatively stable over the last 15 years.\n\nWhile part-time self-employment has become considerably more prevalent over the past 15 years, there are several trends which are common to both the full- and part-time modes. Both groups of workers have seen their age profile get markedly older in recent years. Among both sets of workers a growing number work in the finance & business services industry, with changes in usual hours worked following broadly the trends of employees. In both groups the incidence of higher occupations and long-tenures is above that of employees, and both groups are concentrated in the South East and London – with full-time self-employed workers in particular becoming more concentrated in the capital. \n\nThe evidence presented here also suggests that, in general, self-employed workers are broadly content with their labour market status. Among older part-time self-employed workers in particular, there is little evidence of workers wanting a full-time position, of job search or of dissatisfaction with their self-employed status. Analysis also suggests that those moving from employee positions to self-employment tend to have somewhat higher pre-transition hourly earnings than workers moving to new employee positions: trends which are more consistent with workers making a positive choice, rather than being forced through economic necessity to be self-employed. Among younger and mid-aged self-employed women – in particular those working part-time – the growth in the incidence of self-employment has not been accompanied by growth in the number of people who would prefer to work full-time, nor a clear uptick in the number of workers seeking an alternative job. Among younger part-time self-employed men, however, the picture is less certain. Larger portions of these workers display a greater degree of dissatisfaction with their part-time status and appear to have come directly from unemployment – possibly indicating a choice made under economic hardship. It is among these workers that evidence of under-employment is strongest. \n\nThe paper has also identified a range of labour market dynamics using the longitudinal component of the Labour Force Survey. These analyses suggest that self-employment as a whole tends to benefit from a net inflow from unemployment and from among employees, which offsets a net outflow to inactivity (Figure 42). During the economic downturn, the net flows from unemployment and from among employees fell markedly, leading to a brief net outflow from self-employment as a whole. During the recovery which followed, the net inflow from unemployment was larger – and focussed mostly on transitions to part-time self-employment – while inflows among former employees have been more focussed on transitions to full-time self-employment, and peaked during 2014. The outflow to inactivity has also declined markedly since the downturn – largely as a consequence of lower net outflows from part-time self-employment. This final result is particularly striking given the age mix of the self-employed, which has shifted towards older workers over the recent years. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"ec05c4ca\" />\n\nAlongside these flows between other parts of the labour market and self-employment, the paper has also identified a range of intra-self-employment flows. In particular, the paper identifies rising \"churn\" between full-time and part-time self-employment, and while these movements do not affect the aggregate number of self-employed workers, they are instructive. To some extent, this development likely reflects changes in labour supply brought on by changes in demand conditions: in much the same way that some full-time employees worked shorter hours in response to a fall in demand during the economic downturn, self-employed workers appear to have done the same. However, older workers are also much more likely to make the transition from full-time to part-time self-employment than younger workers, and account for a large portion of the growth in this employment mode in recent years. These transitions rarely involve a change of industry or occupation, consistent with workers simply cutting their hours rather than seeking a new line of work. These trends suggest that some of the rise in part-time self-employment category is to do with workers managing their retirement in a different manner. A larger number of older workers – and the full-time self-employed in particular – appear to be choosing to enter part-time self-employment, rather than retiring directly. This in turn increases the level of participation – consistent with the analysis presented in Figure 4 – and the flow from full-time to part-time self-employment, while dragging on the out-flow to inactivity. \n\nIt is difficult to be sure whether these moves are a positive choice or a matter of economic necessity, but the evidence presented here is more consistent with the former. \n\nWhat do these findings mean for the UK labour market and what implications are there for the degree of spare capacity? The results here broadly support and develop the findings of earlier papers (Tatomir, 2015), (ONS, 2014), that the recent growth of self-employment is a continuation or perhaps, an amplification, of a pre-existing, pre-downturn trend. Much of the recent growth is among a group of older workers – many of whom report broadly positive reasons for choosing to be part-time and self-employed. Much of the growth in this mode of employment also appears to be among workers managing their transition out of the labour market: choosing to work part-time for a period before moving to retirement. As a consequence, these data suggest that the growth of part-time self-employment, in particular among older workers, is a structural feature of the UK labour market which is unlikely to unwind as the economic recovery continues. Among younger workers the evidence is less clear. To the extent that the increase in dissatisfaction among younger male self-employed workers reflects under-employment, some of these efforts may in time be redeployed to different uses as the recovery progresses.  \n","title":"Conclusions & discussion"},{"markdown":"Craig, L., Powell, A. & Cortis, N., 2012.

In April to June 2013 around 67% of women aged 16 to 64 were in work, an increase from 53% in 1971. For men the percentage fell to 76% in 2013 from 92% in 1971.   \n\nIn April to June 2013, looking at the not seasonally adjusted series, around 13.4 million women aged 16 to 64 were in work (42% part-time) and 15.3 million men (12% part-time). For those who worked full-time there were differences in the average hours worked per week. For example, full-time men worked on average 44 hours per week whilst full-time women worked 40 hours per week. While there have been increases in the number of women in work, the percentage of them doing a part-time role has fluctuated between 42-45% over the past 30 years.\n\nMost of the shift in more women and fewer men working happened between 1971 and 1991. Several factors may account for this. One possible factor is the rise of the service sector and decline of the manufacturing sector beginning in the 1960s. Traditionally a higher proportion of women than men have worked in services, with a higher proportion of men working in manufacturing. The growing demand to employ people within the service sector and falling demand within the manufacturing sector may have resulted in more women and fewer men working. Over the period the fall in men working has seen an increase in the number who are inactive. This could be for many reasons, for example between 1971 and 1991 when most of the fall in men in work occurred, many could have taken earlier retirement, left work for health reasons or started sharing childcare responsibilities. Since 1993 there have been increases in young men who are inactive due to study.\n\nSince the 1970s there have been several pieces of new legislation that may have impacted on the employment rate for women:\n\n- 1970 Equal Pay Act – this prohibited any less favourable treatment between men and women in terms of pay\n\n- 1975 Sex Discrimination Act – promoted equality and opportunity between men and women\n\n- 1975 Employment Protection Act – made it illegal to sack a woman due to pregnancy and introduced statutory maternity provision\n\n- 2008 Lone parent income support changes – conditions of eligibility for lone parent income support were changed\n\n- 2010 increase in State Pension Age for women  - women now retiring later than previously\n\n#### Employment rates for men and women aged 16-64, 1971 to 2013, UK\n\n[![Employment rates for men and women aged 16-64, 1971 to 2013, UK](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure1menandwomenemprates_tcm77-328339.png \"Employment rates for men and women aged 16-64, 1971 to 2013, UK\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure1menandwomenemprates_tcm77-328339.png)\n\n##### Source: Labour Force Survey - Office for National Statistics\n\nSince 1991 increases in the percentage of women in work continued but at a slower rate than before. More recently, during the 2008/09 recession the employment rates for men fell more than for women and have since levelled off in the last four years with men’s employment rates remaining between 75% and 77% and women’s at 65% to 67%.\n\nThe rise in women in employment is partly due to an increase in the percentage of mothers in work. In 1996 (when comparable records began), 67% of married or cohabiting mothers with dependent children were in work and by 2013 this had increased to 72%. There has also been an increase in the lone mother’s employment rate from 43% to 60% over the same period. As more women have entered employment there has been a fall in those inactive, which are those who are either not looking for work or not available to work, for example looking after the family. The percentage of women who were inactive gradually fell over the past 40 years to a low of 28% of women aged 16 to 64 in 2013.\n\n### Men have consistently higher employment rates than women above the age of 22\n\nIn 2013, up until the age of 22 the percentage of men and women in work was similar, above this age men consistently had a higher employment rate than women with some women choosing to start a family and not work. The gap between the two rates narrowed at older ages with some women rejoining the labour force when their children are older. At some of the oldest age groups the gap widens as women approach and pass their state pension age and retire while men have to wait until 65 for the state pension age.\n\n#### Employment rates for men and women by individual year of age, April to June 2013, UK\n\n[![Employment rates for men and women by individual year of age, April to June 2013, UK](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure2emprateformenandwomenbyage_tcm77-328342.png \"Employment rates for men and women by individual year of age, April to June 2013, UK\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure2emprateformenandwomenbyage_tcm77-328342.png)\n##### Source: Labour Force Survey - Office for National Statistics\n\nFocusing on women only, employment rates for young women aged 16 to 23 were higher two decades ago in 1993 compared with the same period in 2013, mainly due to greater numbers remaining in full-time education. In 1993 the employment rate for women levelled off during their 20s and early 30s, coinciding with the average age for a woman to give birth to her first child at 26 years.  In 2013 the levelling off took place slightly later, coinciding with an increase in the average age for a woman to give birth to her first child, which is 28 according to the latest figures.  For most ages above 25 the employment rate for women was higher in 2013 than two decades ago, coinciding with a fall in the percentage of women remaining out of the labour force to look after the family and an increase in the percentage of mothers in employment. The difference in women’s employment rates widens for older women aged 50 and above. The increase in the percentage of older women in work in 2013 compared with 1993 may be partially attributable to the rising state pension age. For those in their mid-50s, the 1993 cohort would be women who were born in the 1940s and would have started looking for work in the 1960s and the 2013 cohort would be women born in the 1960s who started looking for work in the 1980s. It may be the latter group are more likely to be in employment as a woman being in work was more fashionable for the latter cohort.\n\n#### Employment rates for women by individual year of age, April to June 1993 and April to June 2013, UK\n\n[![Employment rates for women by individual year of age, April to June 1993 and April to June 2013, UK](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure319932013empratebyageforwomen_tcm77-328345.png \"Employment rates for women by individual year of age, April to June 1993 and April to June 2013, UK\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure319932013empratebyageforwomen_tcm77-328345.png)\n\n##### Source: Labour Force Survey - Office for National Statistics\n\n### Employment rates for women lowest in Northern Ireland and London\n\nLooking across the countries of the UK and regions of England the employment rate for women was highest in the East of England between July 2012 and June 2013 at 69.8% followed by the South West at 69.4% and the South East at 69.3%. The lowest employment rate was in Northern Ireland at 62.3%, followed by London at 62.6% and the North East at 62.9%. The rankings are similar to the overall employment rate that includes men with the exception of London, which is lower down the ranking for women compared with men. This may be linked to the diverse ethnic population within the area with some women who are not in work due to looking after the family.\n\n#### Employment rates for women aged 16 to 64 by area of the UK, July 2012 to June 2013\n\n[![Employment rates for women aged 16 to 64 by area of the UK, July 2012 to June 2013](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure4areasoftheuk_tcm77-328348.png \"Employment rates for women aged 16 to 64 by area of the UK, July 2012 to June 2013\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure4areasoftheuk_tcm77-328348.png)\n\n##### Source: Annual Population Survey (APS) - Office for National Statistics\n\n### Birmingham has the lowest employment rate among the smaller areas\n\nLooking into a little more detail geographically, Birmingham had the lowest employment rate for women across the UK where just over half (50.2%) of women aged 16 to 64 were in work. The next lowest employment rates were in Nottingham (53.5%), Coventry (55.2%) and Leicester (55.2%). Some of these areas have low employment rates because of the universities within them and when considering only women aged 25 to 64, Nottingham and Coventry were no longer towards the bottom but Birmingham still had the lowest employment rate.  One of the reasons for this is that Birmingham has a higher than average proportion of its women that do not work because they are at home looking after their family. This may be linked to the diverse ethnic population within the area.\n\n#### Employment rates for women aged 16 to 64 by local area of Great Britain, July 2012 to June 2013\n\n[![Employment rates for women aged 16 to 64 by local area of Great Britain, July 2012 to June 2013](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure5localareaemprates_tcm77-328349.png \"Employment rates for women aged 16 to 64 by local area of Great Britain, July 2012 to June 2013\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure5localareaemprates_tcm77-328349.png)\n\n##### Source: Annual Population Survey (APS) - Office for National Statistics\n\n### Men with children more likely to work than those without – opposite picture for women\n\nFocusing on women up to the age of 49, for those with children their employment rates were lower than those without children. For men the opposite occurred as men with children were more likely to work than those without.\n\nFor younger males, aged 16-24, a higher percentage of those without children were in full time education compared with those with children. Meanwhile for middle to older aged men, aged 35 and upwards, a higher percentage of men without dependent children were not in work due to long term sickness or disability.\n\n#### Employment rates for men and women living with and without dependent children by age group, April to June 2013, UK\n\n[![Employment rates for men and women living with and without dependent children by age group, April to June 2013, UK](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure6childrenandemploymentrates_tcm77-328354.png \"Employment rates for men and women living with and without dependent children by age group, April to June 2013, UK\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure6childrenandemploymentrates_tcm77-328354.png)\n\n##### Source: Labour Force Survey - Office for National Statistics\n\nThe employment rate gap of mothers with and without dependent children narrowed at older ages, reflecting that the children in the family would be older, making it easier for women to return to work.\n\n### The employment rate gap between mothers in a couple and lone mothers smaller for those with older children\n\nThe age of the child and the relationship status of the mother are important factors in if they are in work or not.  For lone mothers whose youngest child was aged up to three, just 39% were in work, compared with 65% of couples with children in the youngest age group; this was a gap of 26 percentage points. For mothers whose youngest child was at primary school age, between four and ten, employment rates were higher at 74% for those in a couple and 61% for those who were a lone parent, a much narrower gap of 13 percentage points. The narrowing of the gap may reflect that lone mothers have fewer opportunities to go to work when their youngest child is not in school as couples can share childcare with their partner. When the youngest child is of school age, lone parents have greater opportunity to enter a job. The employment rate gap between mothers in couples and on their own narrowed further where the age of the youngest dependent child was between eleven and eighteen, with employment rates of 80% for mothers in a couple and 74% for lone mothers. In recent years, comparing back 2013 with 2008 there has been an increase in the employment rates for lone parents with children aged four and over, while the corresponding rates for couples have remained similar. This has meant the gap between the rates for couples and lone parents has narrowed.\n\n#### Employment rates for mothers in a couple and lone mothers, April to June 2013, UK\n\n[![Employment rates for mothers in a couple and lone mothers, April to June 2013, UK](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure7mothersemploymentrates_tcm77-328355.png \"Employment rates for mothers in a couple and lone mothers, April to June 2013, UK\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure7mothersemploymentrates_tcm77-328355.png)\n\n##### Source: Labour Force Survey - Office for National Statistics\n\n### Men tend to work in professional occupations associated with higher levels of pay\n\nConcentrating on a wider age range of 16 and over, in April-June 2013, 15.9 million men were in employment compared with 14.0 million women. The most common occupation category for both was professional with 19% of men and 21% of women in employment working in professional occupations. Within this professional occupation category workers were spread over a wide variety of jobs but with differences for men and women. For example, the most common occupation for women was nursing while the most common for men was programmers and software development professionals. Men tended to work in professional occupations associated with higher levels of pay. For example programmers and software development professionals earned £20.02 per hour (excluding overtime) while nurses earned on average £16.61 according to the 2012 Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings.\n\n#### The percentage of workers in each occupation group that are women, April to June 2013, UK\n\n[![The percentage of workers in each occupation group that are women, April to June 2013, UK](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure8percentageofwomeninoccupationgroup_tcm77-328358.png \"The percentage of workers in each occupation group that are women, April to June 2013, UK\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure8percentageofwomeninoccupationgroup_tcm77-328358.png)\n\n##### Source: Labour Force Survey - Office for National Statistics\n\n### Women dominate employment within caring and leisure occupations\n\nLooking within each of the occupational groups women dominate employment within occupations within caring and leisure, accounting for 82% of those within these occupation types. The next most common occupations that women dominated were admin and secretarial roles and sales/customer service occupations. At the other end of the scale, women were in the minority within skilled trade occupations, accounting for just 10%, followed by roles within manufacturing such as process, plant and machine operatives.\n\n### The number of women working within managerial roles slightly higher than the EU average\n\nFocusing on occupations within the highest paid category of managers, directors and senior officials, within this latter category around a third (33%) was female in April to June 2013. Looking across the European Union and using information from Eurostat and the International Standard Classification of Occupations for the final quarter of 2012, around 34.8% of women were working as managers, slightly higher than the European Union average of 33.5%. The percentage of managers that were women was slightly lower than the UK figure in the larger economies of Spain (31%), Germany (29%), and Italy (24%) but it was greater in France (39%). Across the European Union as a whole, women were most prominent within the managerial occupation group in Latvia (45%) and Lithuania (41%). The country where women were least prominent as managers was Cyprus (16%).\n\n#### The percentage of women working in senior management roles, October to December 2012, selected countries from the European Union\n\n[![The percentage of women working in senior management roles, October to December 2012, selected countries from the European Union](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure9eucomparison_tcm77-328359.png \"The percentage of women working in senior management roles, October to December 2012, selected countries from the European Union\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure9eucomparison_tcm77-328359.png)\n\n##### Source: Eurostat\n\n### Men are more likely to be employed in higher skilled jobs than women\n\nWhen grouping the above occupations into job skill level a slightly lower percentage of women worked in the highest skilled jobs, which consist of some managers and senior officials along with professional occupations. There was a similar percentage of men and women working in the lowest skill category, consisting of the elementary occupations. Within these low skill roles there were differences in the types of jobs between men and women. Men performed roles such as elementary storage occupations which include tasks such as loading and unloading cargo from ships or furniture from warehouses and women working in roles such as cleaners and domestics.\n\nThe main differences between men and women were in the two middle skilled groups of upper middle (associate professional and technical occupations and skilled trade occupations)and lower middle (admin/secretarial occupations, caring/leisure occupations and sales/customer service occupations). In 2013, 37% of men were employed in the upper middle skilled roles compared with 18% of women and conversely 46% of women were employed in lower middle skilled roles compared with 24% of men.\n\n#### The percentage of working men and women that are in each skill level group, April to June 2013, UK\n\n[![The percentage of working men and women that are in each skill level group, April to June 2013, UK](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure10skilllevel_tcm77-328360.png \"The percentage of working men and women that are in each skill level group, April to June 2013, UK\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure10skilllevel_tcm77-328360.png)\n\n##### Source: Labour Force Survey - Office for National Statistics\n\n### Female graduates more likely to work in a slightly lower skilled occupation group than men\n\nIn 2013, 44% of women in work were graduates who had achieved a qualification that was above an A-level standard, for example having a degree or higher education qualification. This was slightly higher than the 38% of men qualified to a similar level. There is often a link between the qualifications required to do a job and the skill level of a job, with higher skilled jobs requiring a higher level of qualification.\n\nFocusing on graduates, aged 22 and above, and looking at the skill level of their jobs, a slightly higher percentage of men (53%) were in high skill jobs than women (49%). At the other end of the skill scale, there were very few graduates in low skill jobs, just 4% of men and 3% of women. While 31% of men were employed in the second highest skill category of upper middle, 21% of women were employed in this category. As for everyone as a whole, including non-graduates, the main differences between men and women graduates were in the two middle job skill level groups of upper middle and lower middle.\n\nConsequently a higher percentage of female graduates (27%) compared with males (13%) worked in lower middle skill jobs with teaching assistants, care workers and home carers and administrative roles forming the top three jobs for women working in this skill level. More women than men were employed in lower middle skilled jobs despite employed female graduates tending to achieve just as strong degree results, with every three in five of those females (62%) with a degree or equivalent attaining a first or upper second class compared with 56% of men.\n\nFor non-graduates the difference in the two middle skill groups for men and women was much larger, with around 42% of male non-graduates employed in the upper middle group compared with 16% of women. Meanwhile 30% of men and the majority of female non-graduates, 61%, were employed in lower middle skilled jobs such as sales and retail assistants and care workers/home carers. There were a similar percentage of men and women in the lowest skill group but more non-graduate men (14%) were employed in the highest skill group than women (8%).\n\n#### The percentage of male and female graduates and non graduates working in each skill level group, April to June 2013, UK\n\n[![The percentage of male and female graduates and non graduates working in each skill level group, April to June 2013, UK](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/chart12maleandfemalegraduatesbyskilllevelofjob_tcm77-328469.png \"The percentage of male and female graduates and non graduates working in each skill level group, April to June 2013, UK\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/chart12maleandfemalegraduatesbyskilllevelofjob_tcm77-328469.png)\n\n##### Source: Labour Force Survey - Office for National Statistics\n\nComparing women in work with dependent children with those without, the percentage working across the different skill groups was similar for both graduates and non-graduates.\n\n#### The percentage of women working in each skill level group by whether a graduate and whether living with dependent children, April to June 2013, UK\n\n[![The percentage of women working in each skill level group by whether a graduate and whether living with dependent children, April to June 2013, UK](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/tablegraduatesfemaleparentsbarchart_tcm77-328472.png \"The percentage of women working in each skill level group by whether a graduate and whether living with dependent children, April to June 2013, UK\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/tablegraduatesfemaleparentsbarchart_tcm77-328472.png)\n\n##### Source: Labour Force Survey - Office for National Statistics\n\n### Men make up the majority of workers in the top 10% of earners but the gap is lower for those under 30\n\nIndividuals’ pay levels are dependent upon a number of factors, such as their experience, age, qualifications and most importantly their type of job. There are often differences in these between men and women.  For example, men tend to work in higher skilled jobs than women and the professional occupations associated with a higher level of pay.\n\nFocusing on the top 10% of earners for all employees across a number of age bands, to identify what percentage of women were among the highest paid, the majority of those in the top 10% were male for each age group.  However, given this, for the younger age groups of 16-24 and 25-29 the top 10% of earners were more evenly split. As men and women increased in age, the percentage of the top 10% that were female tended to decrease. The greatest fall in the percentage of the top 10% of earners that were women was between the 25-29 and 30-34 age groups, coinciding with women having children in their late twenties. Therefore, the percentage of women in the highest paid reduces after the average age that women tend to give birth to their first child. This may be due to several factors such as women choosing to focus more on family life than their careers.

However, the performances of the headline industries remain widely varied and the trade balance has not seen a sustained improvement.\n\n- Apart from services, growth has been erratic and far more subdued. While production rebounded from a temporary fall in October, overall production output has been broadly flat for the last few months. In addition, construction declined for the second consecutive month. However construction new orders – a leading indicator of construction output – held up in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2016 while the manufacturing industry has seen rising export values relative to domestic sales over the last 12 months.\n\n- The latest UK trade figures also showed strength in goods exports, driven by orders from the EU. However this has been accompanied by increases in imports from both EU and non-EU economies, which has resulted in a widening of the overall goods trade balance in November.\n\n- While no new services data have been released today, previously published data show activity remains robust across a range of sub-industries, but has recently been driven by a faster rate of growth in “consumer-focused” industries such as retail, food and beverage services.\n\n","title":"Main points"},{"markdown":"The 3 bulletins published alongside this article present new information on economic conditions in November 2016, with data available for [output in the production][1] and [construction][2] industries, as well as the [trade balance][3]. These new estimates for November – together with November retail data already published and October data for services – continue to show a growing UK economy, but with variation in the performance of individual industries. The latest data follow gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 0.6% in Quarter 3 2016, a rate unchanged from the previous quarter and in line with longer historical trends.\n\nCommenting on today's short-term indicator figures, Senior ONS statistician Kate Davies said:\n\n“Today’s figures continue to paint a mixed picture of the UK’s economic performance. Production saw significant growth, mainly down to increased oil and gas output as the Buzzard field came back online along with a boost from the volatile pharmaceuticals industry. \n\n“However, the trade deficit widened as imports of transport equipment, chemicals and portable computers helped eclipse rising exports, while falls in repair work and commercial building led to a small overall decline in construction.\n\n\"Overall, construction and production output has been broadly flat over the last few months.” \n\nThe services industries – which drove overall gross domestic product (GDP) growth in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2016 – saw their output rise by a further 0.3% in October, continuing a rate of growth seen over the last 6 years. Production output also rose by 2.1% in November, following a fall in output in the previous month; however a significant proportion of this growth (as well as the fall in the previous period) reflects the timing of maintenance for some North Sea oil rigs. Overall, production output has remained flat in the past few months. The construction industry recorded a slight fall in monthly output, with a decline in all repair and maintenance outweighing growth in new housing construction.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"84d5d0ce\" />\n\nLooking over a longer period shows services provided the largest and most consistent contribution to growth in the UK economy over the last couple of years. Figure 1 plots output across the 3 headline GDP output components, as well as the volume of retail sales, from the start of 2010. Between Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2010 and Quarter 3 2016 services accounted for 13.3 percentage points of the 14.7% overall gross value added (GVA) growth – a higher proportion of that growth than the industry’s relative size – while construction and production growth were more erratic over this period^1^. Both have also clearly been more subdued since the start of 2015.\n\n####Notes for: Introduction and statistician comment\n\n1. Gross Value Added (GVA) is a measure of the value of goods and services output (excluding intermediate consumption). GVA plus taxes and minus subsidies is equal to gross domestic product (GDP).\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/bulletins/indexofproduction/nov2016\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/constructionindustry/bulletins/constructionoutputingreatbritain/nov2016\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/uktrade/nov2016","title":"Introduction and statistician comment"},{"markdown":"Services output has recently been supported by strong growth in a range of “consumer-focused industries”, as well as retail trade. For example Figure 1 shows retail sales continuing to outpace total services output (sales rose 2.1% in the 3 months to November 2016, the fastest rate since January 2015). The value of internet retail sales has risen strongly in recent months: comparing the 3 months to November 2016 with the 3 months to November 2015 shows growth of 26%, the fastest rate since August 2009. Services industries that include restaurants, cafes, bars, and TV and cinema activities also recorded stronger growth compared to total services in Quarter 3 2016.\n\nThe role of tourist behaviour in contributing to this activity is difficult to assess. Growth in the volume of “watches and jewellery” sales rose strongly from 9.8% in July to 16.6% in October, which could be attributed to tourists taking advantage of the weaker sterling value. However, the series can be erratic and growth subsequently [fell back to 10.6% in November][2]. In addition data from our International Passenger Survey up to October 2016 suggests that the number of trips to the UK has been flat since the start of the year, and that average expenditure per trip declined over the same period.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/timeseries/jo4q/drsi\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/timeseries/jo4q/drsi","title":"Services "},{"markdown":"Although production output fell immediately following the end of Quarter 3 in October, the latest data show output rising by 2.1% in November, the largest monthly increase since April 2016. These data were strongly affected by movements in oil extraction output, which fell by 9.8% in October and bounced back to grow by 10.3% in November (subtracting and adding approximately a percentage point to production growth respectively). Both reflect the timing of maintenance for some of the North Sea’s oil rigs – which temporarily reduces output for the duration of the work.\n\nHowever away from this temporary factor, manufacturing output also saw a broad-based rise in output, recovering by 1.3% in November following a 1.0% fall in October. Some respondents cited that their customers brought forward UK export orders soon after the sharp fall in sterling in July, and the latest month showed further strength in export figures for both the pharmaceutical and motor vehicle industries.\n\nThis continues a longer-run trend of rising manufacturing export turnover relative to domestic sales turnover, across a large number of manufacturing sub-industries shown in Figure 2. Those that have increased their share by the largest amount include pharmaceuticals – which attributed 64% of turnover to exports in the 12 months to November – as well as computer and electrical products and transport equipment.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"24c14621\" />\n","title":"Production"},{"markdown":"The latest trade figures showed continued strength in goods exports in November 2016. Although the UK trade in goods deficit worsened in November – to £12.2 billion from £9.9 billion – the overall value of goods exports rose 2.8% in the month and by 13.5% in the year to November. Exports rose most strongly to the EU (8.7%) but this coincided with a 9.4% rise in imports from the EU, leading to a widening of the EU goods trade balance (Figure 3). The trade balance with the “rest of the world” widened to a greater extent – with exports to this group falling 2.4% while imports rose 7.0%.\n\nIt should be noted that trade prices have been heavily influenced by recent sterling movements. Goods export and import prices have fallen slightly in November (by 1.9% and 1.0 % respectively), coinciding with sterling appreciating by 2.7% against a basket of currencies. Additional information on sterling movements and its effect on trade prices can be found in the [Economic Review][1] and [Producer Price Inflation][2] publications.\n\nLower trade prices have also coincided with a 1.1% fall in the total input price index (the prices manufacturers are charged for intermediate inputs used in the production process) and flat output price growth (the prices charged for finished manufactured goods) in the month to November. \n\nMore broadly, the IMF global commodity price index (on a dollars basis) also fell by 1.2% in November 2016 but remains 9.5% higher compared with November 2015. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"15990e3c\" />\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/economicreview/previousReleases\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/producerpriceinflation/previousReleases","title":"Trade"},{"markdown":"Although construction output grew strongly between 2013 and 2015, output has been subdued since and the latest month showed the second consecutive month of falling output. However there have been large differences in the performance of lower level types of work. For example comparing November 2016 with November 2015, new housing work grew by 12.6% over this period. In contrast, all repair and maintenance (which accounts for just over a third of construction output) fell by 3.6%.\n\nWhile construction output fell slightly (0.2%) in November, and has fallen slightly since early-2016, [new construction orders][1] held up in the latest data. New orders measure the value of new (legally binding) contracts for future construction work and are widely regarded as a leading indicator of construction output.\n\nDespite a small decline between Quarter 2 (Apr to Jun) and Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2016, the volume of new orders remains 5.5% higher than Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2015: types of work that were especially strong were new housing and commercial work to tender. Figure 4 shows that new housing output tends to be best correlated with a 2 quarter lag in new housing orders. The growth of housing orders suggests that any pre-referendum uncertainty that existed did not translate into a trend decline in housing new orders to tender.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"e50583c6\" />\n\nWe also publish a project and regional breakdown of new orders – which reveals some interesting trends in the construction industry. Comparing the pre-downturn period with the 4 quarters to Quarter 3 2016, shows an increasing share of total orders attributable to infrastructure and housing, while the share of commercial and industrial work has fallen (the latter could be explained by a smaller manufacturing base relative to the whole economy). Across the regions, London has historically claimed a large share of construction, and has been the only region to achieve a notable proportionate rise between the pre and post-downturn periods.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/constructionindustry/bulletins/constructionoutputingreatbritain/previousReleases","title":"Construction"}],"_abstract":null,"latestRelease":false,"unit":null,"dateChanges":null,"versions":[],"relatedArticles":null,"entities":{"persons":["Kate Davies","Gross Value Added"],"organizations":["IMF","GVA","UK","Economic Review"],"dates":["October 2016","end of","2010","November 2016 with November 2015","April 2016","since early - 2016","October","Today","November 2016","fall","2016","2015","2013","today","Quarter 3","12 months","July","since August 2009","November","since January 2015"],"locations":["London","North Sea"]},"relatedData":[],"relatedMethodology":[],"preUnit":null},"matched_queries":["logged_featureset"]},{"fields":{"_ltrlog":[{"log_entry":[{"name":"1","value":0.0},{"name":"2","value":0.9642559}]}]},"_index":"article","_type":"document","_id":"AWA1nXYl90MS5JzXGf5M","_score":0.0,"_source":{"description":{"nextRelease":"","keywords":["manufacturing","output per worker","regression analysis"],"releaseDate":"2017-04-04T23:00:00.000Z","edition":"2015","source":"","title":"An initial assessment of regional management practices","metaDescription":" A small sample of single-site British manufacturing businesses from the Management Practice Survey pilot finds no evidence of regional variation in management practices.","nationalStatistic":false,"_abstract":" A small sample of single-site British manufacturing businesses from the Management Practice Survey pilot finds no evidence of regional variation in management practices.","latestRelease":true,"unit":"","contact":{"name":"Gaganan Awano","telephone":"+44(0)1633 651521","email":" productivity@ons.gov.uk"},"preUnit":""},"edition":null,"section":null,"source":null,"type":"article","metaDescription":null,"contact":null,"relatedDocuments":[{"uri":"/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/articles/ukproductivityintroduction/latest"},{"uri":"/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/bulletins/labourproductivity/latest"},{"uri":"/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/articles/quarterlypublicserviceproductivityexperimentalstatistics/latest"},{"uri":"/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/articles/exploringlabourproductivityinruralandurbanareasingreatbritain/latest"},{"uri":"/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/bulletins/internationalcomparisonsofproductivityfinalestimates/latest"},{"uri":"/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/articles/labourproductivitymeasuresfromtheannualbusinesssurvey/latest"},{"uri":"/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/articles/multifactorproductivityestimates/latest"},{"uri":"/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/articles/introducingquarterlyregionallabourinputmetrics/latest"}],"markdown":null,"links":[],"accordion":[],"releaseDate":null,"topics":[],"relatedDatasets":null,"uri":"/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/articles/managementpracticesandproductivityaregionalperspective/2015","nationalStatistic":false,"sections":[{"markdown":"ONS collected information on management practices for the first time in 2016 using the pilot Management Practices Survey (MPS). [Published analysis of these data][1] shows that larger businesses have higher levels of structured management practices, and that there is a positive association between businesses’ use of structured management practices and their levels of labour productivity (Awano et al, 2017). \n\nIn response to user requests, we have explored whether the pilot dataset could provide management practice results at the regional level. Due to the limitations discussed in detail in the next section, we are only able to provide conditional analysis of relationships for a sample of single-site businesses. We cannot draw conclusions on regional variation in the population of such businesses, or the wider population of all manufacturing businesses. These conditional results show broadly similar results to our previous analysis with no strong regional component to variation in management scores or labour productivity. However, the analysis does exemplify the kind of work that we intend to carry out with a larger sample in the future.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/articles/experimentaldataonthemanagementpracticesofmanufacturingbusinessesingreatbritain/experimentalestimatesfor2015","title":"Introduction"},{"markdown":"The limitations arise from features of our data which mean that the sample available for regional analysis is small and unrepresentative of the manufacturing industry when disaggregated to a regional level.\n\n###Results for Great Britain\n\nThe Management Practices Survey (MPS) sampled 1,026 manufacturing businesses in Great Britain; 68% of this sample responded to the survey, and 59% of the sample provided responses to both the MPS and the Annual Business Survey (ABS). This allowed us to link management and productivity data at the business level, and also to produce average management scores across industries and size bands in Great Britain. Quality measures (that is, standard errors) to indicate the level of the precision of these estimates have not been produced. It is therefore important that the estimates are treated with caution.\n\n###Regional results\n\nThe sample design for MPS did not include any regional stratification, as the primary aim for this pilot survey was to produce results for Great Britain. This poses the risk that some regions in Great Britain may be under-represented, or within regions, some industries or business size bands may be disproportionately represented relative to the actual business populations in that region. The sample in each region will also be much smaller and this will result in a lower level of precision for any estimates.\n\nBoth MPS and ABS collect data at the Reporting Unit level of the business^1^. However, as businesses may operate on more than one site and span more than one region, it can be difficult to accurately attribute contributions to the business’s management scores and productivity across sites, and hence across regions. For this regional analysis, the sample has been restricted to single-site businesses, so all information can be confidently attributed to a single region. This reduces our sample to just fewer than 350 businesses. The numbers of observations in each region are therefore small and as such if weighted estimates for the population were produced, the resulting estimate could be driven by very few businesses in the sample. The reliability of estimates derived from these small numbers is likely to be very low but cannot be quantified without the associated standard errors. Also, by restricting the sample to single-site businesses, the sample is skewed towards smaller businesses, and is less representative of the manufacturing population as a whole. \n\nTherefore, to avoid overconfident interpretation of these results we have not produced population estimates of management scores and labour productivity by region. Instead we have used this sample of single-site businesses to produce conditional estimates for regional variation using regression analysis. These regression results cannot be used to infer the characteristics of or draw conclusions regarding single-site manufacturing businesses in general, or indeed for the broader manufacturing business population. The purpose of these results is to provide a timely insight using the limited data available, which should be used with caution.\n\nNotes for: Limitations of this analysis\n\n1. [Evans and Welpton (2009)][1] provide further information on how we treat businesses for statistical purposes.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/elmr/economic-and-labour-market-review/no--6--june-2009/methods-explained--business-structure-database.pdf","title":"Limitations of this analysis"},{"markdown":"We used multivariate regressions to estimate conditional relationships between businesses’ management scores and their characteristics. In columns (1) and (3) of Table 1 we replicate the analysis in Awano et al. (2017) for our sample of single-site businesses as an initial point of comparison. We find a very similar picture to our previous results: an increase in employment of 10% associated with a management score that is 0.01 points higher, and we see no significant relationships between management score and any other characteristic.\n\nWhen adding in region indicators we find little change in the estimates for size and other characteristics. These regional indicators use “London and South East” as the reference region. In column (2), estimating regional effects conditional on employment and industry, we find no regional results which are significant at the 5% level or below. However, both the North East and Yorkshire and The Humber have weakly significant (that is, significant at the 10% level) positive associations with management scores; for both regions, scores are higher by 0.08. However, given this low level of significance, we recommend caution in drawing conclusions from these results. The small sample may also make it difficult to pick up any other relationships which may be present, and the special characteristics of this sample may mean that results we observe here may not translate to the overall business population.\n\nIn column (4), with regional indicators added to the more detailed specification, we see similar regional results to column (2), with management scores in the North East higher by 0.07 and in Yorkshire and The Humber scores are 0.08 higher; however, we caution against drawing strong conclusions for the reasons outlined above. \n\n<ons-table path=\"e38153ab\" />","title":"Estimating relationships between management score and business characteristics"},{"markdown":"Similarly to the previous section, we estimate relationships with labour productivity, presented in Table 2. We find that for our sample of single-site businesses, the unconditional relationship between management score and labour productivity is positive and significant, with a 0.1 higher management score associated with labour productivity which is 8.9% higher, as we also found in our previous estimates for the population of manufacturing businesses with employment of at least 10 in Great Britain. Column (2) shows the relationship between management score and labour productivity is very similar when introducing regional indicators, and that for our sample there is no significant regional variation. We see no individual region indicator is significant and when testing the joint significance of the regional indicators, we cannot reject the hypothesis that all indicators are equal to zero (the p-value for this test is 0.676).\n\nWhen we control for business size and industry, the magnitude relationship between management score and productivity for single-site businesses is reduced, but still remains strongly significant. Again, when including regional indicators, we see no significant associations.\n\nFinally we include our other observed business characteristics in columns (5) and (6). Before including the regional indicators, our sample of single-site businesses performs somewhat differently to our previous estimates for our population of interest (manufacturing businesses in Great Britain with employment of at least 10). The association between management score and productivity is slightly lower, with a 0.1 higher management score associated with a 5% higher level of labour productivity. Most notably we do not see a significant negative relationship between family ownership and productivity in this sample. We do however see a weakly significant relationship between multinational status and productivity, with multinational businesses reporting 15% higher productivity.\n\nOnce we include regional indicators in column (6) we see very little change in results relative to column (5), and again, no significant regional variation. However, as throughout this analysis, these results cannot be applied to the manufacturing industry as a whole. Estimates for this population require a larger sample designed for regional analysis.\n\n<ons-table path=\"6592789f\" />\n","title":"Estimating relationships between productivity and business characteristics"},{"markdown":"The overall picture from this analysis is that there is no strong regional component to variation in management scores or labour productivity in our sample of single-site manufacturing businesses with employment of at least 10.

We continue to see strong positive associations between management score and labour productivity, with a 0.1 increase in management score associated with an unconditional increase in labour productivity of 8.9%, or a conditional increase of 5%. We intend that future data collection for the Management Practices Survey (MPS) will use a larger sample and will be designed to collect data at a regional level.","title":"Conclusion"},{"markdown":"Awano, G., Heffernan, A. and Robinson, H. 2017, “[Management practices and productivity among manufacturing businesses in Great Britain: Experimental estimates for 2015][1]”, Office for National Statistics.\n\nEvans, Peter and Richard Welpton, 2009, “Business Structure Database”, Economic & Labour Market Review, 3(6), pp. 71 to 75\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/articles/experimentaldataonthemanagementpracticesofmanufacturingbusinessesingreatbritain/experimentalestimatesfor2015","title":"References"},{"markdown":"5 April 2017: [UK productivity introduction: Oct to Dec 2016][1] draws together the headlines of the productivity releases into a single release, providing additional analysis of our productivity statistics.\n\n5 April 2017: [Labour productivity: Oct to Dec 2016][2] contains the latest estimates of labour productivity for the whole economy and a range of industries, together with estimates of unit labour costs.\n\n5 April 2017: [International comparisons of UK productivity (ICP), final estimates: 2015][3] presents an international comparison of labour productivity across the G7 nations, in terms of growth in GDP per hour and GDP per worker.\n\n5 April 2017: [Multi-factor productivity estimates: Experimental estimates to 2015][4] decomposes output growth into the contributions that can be accounted for by labour and capital inputs.

The differences between the outputs are not a new phenomenon but have existed for many years and are the result of different revisions policies in the NA and the PSF. The NA being necessarily revised less frequently than the PSF due to the added complexity and integrated nature of the NA which need to balance across all sectors of the economy and not just the public sector.\n\nIt is important to note that the differences do not reflect conceptual differences in the compilation of the outputs. All NA and PSF publications are based on the National Accounts framework and are compiled in accordance with the standards set out in the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) under European law.\n\nThis article is an update to a [similar article published alongside the Blue Book 2015][1] in October 2015. The article presents some of the reasons behind the differences in the NA and the PSF datasets and gives an overview of the work which is planned to be completed over the next year to bring the 2 outputs into closer alignment. The article is structured as follows:\n\nSection 3 – provides background on the NA and the PSF outputs and the reasons why they differ;\n\nSection 4 – provides detail on the main alignment differences between the NA and the PSF as at June 2016;\n\nSection 5 – provides information on the plans for future alignment work;\n\nAppendix A – illustrates the extent of differences between the NA and the PSF datasets in June 2016.\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/economy/national-accounts/articles/2011-present/progress-of-aligning-public-sector-finances-to-national-accounts-between-2013-and-2015.pdf","title":"Introduction"},{"markdown":"###3.1 National Accounts (NA)\nThe term NA in this article refers to those integrated outputs and datasets which form the core National Accounts. The outputs include (but are not limited to) the annual Blue Book and annual Balance of Payments (Pink Book), the Quarterly National Accounts, the UK Economic Accounts and the Gross Domestic Product (preliminary and second estimates). Specifically, the NA dataset used in this article is that of the Quarterly National Accounts published on 30 June 2016 and the related Blue Book 2016 dataset.\n\nThe primary purpose of the NA is to provide an integrated description of all economic activity within the UK. It is used heavily by policy makers and analysts to provide a coherent macro-economic picture of the UK through important measures such as gross domestic product (GDP), household saving ratio and the balance of trade. The integrated nature of NA means that there is less flexibility for taking on revisions and so the data published in the NA are only open for revision in specific periods. The detail of which periods are open for revision varies by quarter.\n\n###3.2 Public Sector Finances (PSF)\nThe term PSF in this article refers to those outputs and datasets which form the suite of public sector finance statistics. The outputs include (but are not limited to) the monthly Public Sector Finances, the quarterly Government Deficit and Debt (under the Maastricht Treaty) bulletin and the related international transmissions of Government Finance Statistics. Specifically, the [PSF dataset][1] used in this article is that published on 21 June 2016.\n\nThe primary purpose of the PSF is to inform its users of the state of the public sector finances and the fiscal position. To do this it is important that the latest events and statistical classifications are reflected in the data and so the data published in the PSF are open for comprehensive revision every month for all time periods. \n\n###3.3 Revisions Policies\nThe inconsistencies between NA and PSF are not conceptual in nature but are the result of the application of different revisions policies. The revisions policies and data compilation processes for NA and PSF were deliberately separated from July 2004 in order to better meet the needs of the users of government finance statistics, as recommended by a 2002 National Statistics Quality Review. As noted above, the [PSF Revisions Policy][2] allows revisions to be taken on in any publication and for all time periods, but the [NA Revisions Policy][3] is much more restrictive, due to the integrated nature of the accounts, generally only allowing long time series revisions at a single point in the year. This means that the PSF usually incorporates data and methodological revisions affecting the public finances ahead of the NA.\n\nAlthough the original intention was that the NA would come into alignment with the PSF at the earliest opportunity, the differences between the 2 datasets built up over a number of years. Over the last few years, work has been undertaken to bring the datasets back into closer alignment, although at any one point in time there are always likely to be some differences as a result of the different revisions policies. This article summarises the main reasons for differences between the 2 datasets as at June 2016.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/may16\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/revisions/revisionspoliciesforeconomicstatistics/publicsectorfinancesrevisionspolicytcm77184697.pdf\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/revisions/revisionspoliciesforeconomicstatistics/nationalaccountsrevisionspolicy2016jan16.pdf","title":"Background"},{"markdown":"###4.1 Differences in Public Sector Net Borrowing\n\nFigure 1 compares public sector net borrowing as published in the National Accounts and in the Public Sector Finances in June 2016. It can be seen that the 2 datasets are closely aligned between the financial year ending March 1998 and the financial year ending March 2016, but there is an observable divergence in the published figures from the financial year ending March 2009 onwards. This divergence in recent years is largely due to the reclassification of English “housing associations” (more properly known as English private registered providers of social housing) from being private corporations to public corporations. The classification decision applies from July 2008 and has been implemented in the Public Sector Finances but not the National Accounts.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"e7086846\" />  \n\nAppendix A shows, in tabular format, the differences in central government net borrowing, local government net borrowing and non-financial public corporations’ net borrowing. Where the differences are due to methodological and classification differences between National Accounts and Public Sector Finances, these are shown in the table.\n\n###4.2 Methodological Improvements and Classifications Implemented in the PSF\n\nSince September 2015, when the Quarterly National Accounts consistent with Blue Book 2015 were published, there have been a number of classifications implemented in the Public Sector Finances which have not yet been introduced into the National Accounts as well as some methodological improvements. These changes have led to a divergence in the net borrowing reported in the Public Sector Finances and the National Accounts.\n\n###4.2.1\tImplementation of reclassification of “housing associations”\n\nThe reclassification of English private registered providers of social housing (referred to in this article as housing associations) from the private to the public corporation sector was reflected in public sector finances for the first time in the [January 2016 PSF statistical bulletin][1]. This [reclassification][2], announced on 30 October 2015, affects over 1,500 bodies providing social housing and applies back to July 2008 when the controls in the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 came into force. The impact of the reclassification is to increase the net borrowing for public corporations by between £2 billion and £4 billion a year.\n\n###4.2.2\tImprovements to coverage of departmental revenue data\n\nThrough a joint programme of quality assurance work by the Office for National Statistics and HM Treasury, additional departmental income was identified that had not been previously incorporated in the Public Sector Finances (or National Accounts). This income was included for the first time in Public Sector Finances in the [January 2016 PSF statistical bulletin][3]. The majority of the additional income, approximately £500 million a year since 2008, related to fees for services and goods. A further £350 million a year of income (approximately) related to miscellaneous transfers and rent. \n\n###4.2.3\tIntroduction of data for community infrastructure levy\n\nCommunity infrastructure levy is a planning charge, introduced by the [Planning Act 2008][4] as a tool for local authorities in England and Wales to help deliver infrastructure to support the development of their area. The community infrastructure levy was included for the first time in public sector finances in the [November 2015 PSF statistical bulletin][5]. Its inclusion has reduced local government net borrowing from financial year ending March 2013 onwards. In the financial year ending March 2015 borrowing was reduced by around £100 million.\n\n###4.2.4\tIntroduction of data for light dues\n\nLight dues are charges that are levied on ships for the maintenance of lighthouses and other aids to navigation. Light dues were included for the first time in the Public Sector Finances in the [November 2015 PSF statistical bulletin][6]. The inclusion of these receipts has led to a decrease in central government net borrowing of approximately £100 million a year.\n\n###4.2.5\tImprovements to local government interest payable estimates\n\nThrough quality assurance work improvements to the calculation of local government interest payable were identified. These improvements were included for the first time in the [February 2016 PSF statistical bulletin][7] and led to small reductions in local government net borrowing of less than £50 million a year.\n\n###4.2.6\tAir Travel Organisers’ Licensing (ATOL) protection contributions\n\nIn addition to the above recent implementations in the Public Sector Finances, there are some differences between Public Sector Finances and National Accounts which were present in September 2015, but which have yet to be brought into alignment. The principal methodological difference in this category is the inclusion of ATOL protection contributions.\n\nATOL protection contributions from airline and travel companies are classified as taxes on production. These contributions were included for the first time in public sector finances in the March 2015 statistical bulletin. The inclusion of these receipts have led to a decrease in central government net borrowing of between £20 and £60 million a year from April 2008 onwards. \n\n###4.3 Methodological Improvements and Classifications Implemented in Blue Book 2016\n\nA number of improvements have been introduced in Blue Book 2016 and the related Quarterly National Accounts, which impact on public sector finance statistics. Some of these improvements have been made simultaneously within National Accounts and the Public Sector Finance statistics, while others had previously been included in the Public Sector Finances and were being included in National Accounts for the first time in June 2016. As a result of the changes being implemented in both National Accounts and Public Sector Finances there is no impact on the differences between the 2 datasets in June 2016, as presented in this article. However, the improvements have led to revised borrowing figures since Blue Book 2015 and so the main methodological changes are listed here for information:\n\n- changes to the treatment of non-market output and social transfers in kind\n- introduction of Government Standardised Guarantees (Help to Buy Mortgage Guarantees)\n- introduction of Crossrail Business Rate Supplement\n- improvements to Transport for London Capital Stock changes\n\nFor more information on these methodological changes see Blue Book 2016 methodology articles published in [February 2016][8] and [June 2016][9].\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/january2016\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/na-classification/national-accounts-sector-classification/classification-update---october-2015/index.html\n  [3]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/january2016\n  [4]: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/29/contents\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/november2015\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/november2015\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/february2016\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/methodologies/nationalaccountsarticlesmethodologicalimprovementstonationalaccountsforbluebook2016marketnonmarketoutputp131p132andsocialtransfersinkindd631d632forgovernment\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/nationalaccountsarticles/detailedassessmentofchangestosectorandfinancialaccounts1997to2014","title":"National accounts and public sector finance alignment"},{"markdown":"The published [National Accounts Medium-Term Work Plan 2015 to 2018][1] noted that:\n\n“Due to the other NA priorities very limited additional alignment work is currently planned for 2016 but more alignment work is planned for Blue Book 2017. However, NA will consider individual classification decisions that are likely to have a significant impact on a case-by-case basis to assess whether it is possible to introduce them into the National Accounts sooner.” \n\nIn accordance with the work plan relatively little was done in the way of alignment between PSF and NA datasets between Blue Book 2015 and Blue Book 2016. As described in section 4.2 of this article there are, as of June 2016, 6 main methodological differences between public sector net borrowing in the NA and the PSF. By far the largest of these differences is due to the implementation in public sector finances of the classification of housing associations.\n \nWe will publish the detailed scope for Blue Book 2017 in the autumn of 2016, but the intention will be, to as far as possible, bring the NA and PSF datasets into alignment through the implementation in National Accounts of the methodological improvements and classification changes described in this article, including the reclassification of “housing associations”. Of course, it is to be expected that between Blue Book 2016 and Blue Book 2017 the PSF dataset will further diverge from the NA dataset as other classifications and methodological improvements are implemented in the PSF which, due to the NA Revisions Policy, cannot be implemented in quarterly NA publications. Where possible these changes will be reflected in Blue Book 2017, but there are always likely to be some differences between the PSF and NA datasets. By its nature, the process of alignment between the NA and the PSF is not a one-off activity but something that needs to happen at frequent intervals to avoid widening divergence.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/get-involved/consultations-and-user-surveys/consultations/national-accounts-mid-term-work-plan-2015-to-2018/index.html","title":"Future planned alignment work"}],"_abstract":null,"latestRelease":false,"unit":null,"dateChanges":null,"versions":[],"relatedArticles":null,"entities":{"persons":["Pink Book","Gross Domestic Product","Appendix A"],"organizations":["National Accounts and Public Sector Finances","Office","London Capital Stock","Crossrail Business Rate Supplement","PSF","National Statistics Quality Review","Wales","NA Revisions Policy","National Accounts","Housing","ATOL","UK Public Sector Finances","UK Economic Accounts","UK","Work","Public Sector Finances","HM Treasury","National Statistics","PSF Revisions Policy","Through","Public Sector Finance","Government Finance Statistics","Air Travel Organisers","Community"],"dates":["March 1998","March 2009","July 2008","September 2015","2010","July 2004","2008","1997","ESA","2002","March 2015","March 2013","January","a year","February","next year","February 2016","a","October 2015","2015 to 2018","March 2016","April 2008","June 2016","2016","2015","2014"],"locations":["NA","Buy","England"]},"relatedData":[{"uri":"/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/datasets/differencesbetweenbluebook2016andthepublicsectorfinancesasatjune2016forcentralgovernmentlocalgovernmentandnonfinancialpubliccorporationsnetborrowing"}],"relatedMethodology":[],"preUnit":null},"matched_queries":["logged_featureset"]},{"fields":{"_ltrlog":[{"log_entry":[{"name":"1","value":0.0},{"name":"2","value":1.0318927}]}]},"_index":"article","_type":"document","_id":"AWA1nXYl90MS5JzXGf5s","_score":0.0,"_source":{"description":{"latestRelease":true,"unit":"","keywords":["LEPs","regional"],"releaseDate":"2015-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","contact":{"name":"Richard Prothero","telephone":"+44 (0)1329 447825","email":"better.info@ons.gsi.gov.uk"},"edition":"1997-2013","source":"","title":"GVA for Local Enterprise Partnerships","metaDescription":"This release provides data on economic output, as measured by nominal gross value added, for each local enterprise partnership (LEP).

The GVA estimates presented here are on a workplace basis (allocated to the location where the economic activity takes place).\n\n\tGVA estimates are presented in current basic prices.

The income approach to calculating GVA produces only current price estimates because some income components cannot easily be converted into prices and volume (e.g. gross operating surplus).\n\n\tAs with the National Accounts, regional, sub-regional and local GVA estimates (including LEP GVA estimates) are calculated as reliably as possible. There is no easy way to measure the reliability of the estimates but ONS carries out consistency checks on data inputs, applies methods consistently and makes use of local knowledge through consultation with key users. The estimates are partly based on sample surveys and the quality of the results therefore varies according to sample size. This means that the results for smaller regions are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than those for larger regions.\n\n2.

In each case, the LEP boundaries used have been an amalgamation of one or more local authority. In other words, for each local authority associated with a LEP data covering the whole of that local authority are included within the LEP data. \nThere are two cases, however, where the working boundaries of a LEP cut through existing local authority boundaries.

The three largest English cities, London, Birmingham and Manchester were amongst the areas with the highest nominal GVA growth rates in 2013. The LEP with the lowest growth rate in 2013 was The Marches.\n\n<ons-table path=\"/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/articles/gvaforlocalenterprisepartnerships/2015-02-19/30daca9e\" />\n\nTable 2 presents data over a longer time period, in this case showing the LEPs with the highest and lowest average annual growth rates from 2008 to 2013.   As such, it gives some indication of how areas have performed since the early stages of the economic downturn. \nThe highest annual average growth rates over this period were to be found in Oxfordshire followed by other LEP areas in the South and West of England, namely London, Worcestershire, Buckinghamshire Thames Valley and Gloucestershire. Areas that had the lowest growth in this period included four northern LEPs (Cheshire and Warrington, Tees Valley, Humber and Lancashire) and Hertfordshire.\n\n<ons-table path=\"/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/articles/gvaforlocalenterprisepartnerships/2015-02-19/515421d6\" />\n\nThe final table in this section summarises average annual growth rates over the full decade to 2013 thereby capturing economic performance both prior to the economic downturn as well as performance during the downturn and subsequent economic recovery. The highest average annual growth rate for nominal GVA over this ten year period was in London where nominal growth rates averaged 5.0% per annum. The lowest growth rate was in Lancashire at 2.5% per annum.\n\n<ons-table path=\"/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/articles/gvaforlocalenterprisepartnerships/2015-02-19/24549d67\" />","title":"Total GVA"},{"markdown":"GVA per head data can be a useful way of comparing regions of different sizes. It allows us to examine growth in economic output over time relative to changes in the size of the population. GVA per head data can be considered to provide an indicative guide to the relative economic performance of an area, but it should be noted that it is not strictly a direct measure of either labour productivity or of household incomes. \n\nLEPs data on labour productivity, which can be considered a direct measure of economic performance, can be found in the latest [ONS subregional productivity publication](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/regional-trends/regional-economic-analysis/sub-regional-productivity--february-2015/art-subregional-productivity.html \"ART Subregional Productivity\") which includes LEPs data for the first time. LEPs data for incomes within the houshold sector will follow later in 2015 with the publication of Gross Disposable Household Income data.\n\nFor the latest 2013 data, Table 4 (calculated on an index basis, UK=100) lists the LEP areas with the highest levels of GVA per head.  London and Thames Valley Berkshire have GVA per head output substantially above that for other LEP areas.  Among the remainder of the top 10 LEP areas, only Cheshire and Warrington LEP is located in the north of England.\n\n<ons-table path=\"/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/articles/gvaforlocalenterprisepartnerships/2015-02-19/d640bacd\" />\n\nTable 5 presents the data for the LEPs with the highest and lowest annual growth rates in GVA per head in 2013. It is similar to Table 1 which presented equivalent data for Total GVA.\n\n<ons-table path=\"/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/articles/gvaforlocalenterprisepartnerships/2015-02-19/8d07b666\" />\n\nTable 6 presents the data for the LEPs with the highest and lowest average annual growth rates in GVA per head over the period 2008 - 2013. It is similar to Table 2 which presented equivalent data for Total GVA.\n\n<ons-table path=\"/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/articles/gvaforlocalenterprisepartnerships/2015-02-19/6aa0c2ee\" />\n\nTable 7 presents the data for the LEPs with the highest and lowest average annual growth rates in GVA per head over the period 2003 - 2013. It is similar to Table 3 which presented equivalent data for Total GVA. Even after accounting for the effects of population growth, London remains the LEP area with the highest growth rate over this period.\n\n<ons-table path=\"/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/articles/gvaforlocalenterprisepartnerships/2015-02-19/f399b75e\" />","title":"GVA per head"},{"markdown":"For each local enterprise partnership, the GVA data are available broken down into 11 industry groups for the 1997 to 2012 period, with these data available in the reference tables associated with this release. Different industries are more or less important to different areas of the country. This is examined in Table 8 which shows for each industry in 2012, the three LEPs in which the industry accounted for the highest share of that LEP's GVA.\n\nFor example, in Table 8, it can be seen that Agriculture, forestry and fishing accounted for 4% of the GVA of ‘The Marches’ LEP and 3% of total GVA in York and North Yorkshire and in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. These are the three LEPs to which Agriculture, forestry and fishing provided the biggest share of total GVA in 2011.\n\nLarge industry sectors shown in Table 8 include Manufacturing which for example accounted for 25% of GVA in Cumbria; the ‘Wholesale & Retail; Transport; and Accommodation’ industry grouping which for example accounted for 26% of GVA in Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire; and the ‘Public Administration, Health and Education’ industry grouping which accounted for 27% of GVA in North Eastern LEP.\n\nTable 8 also shows that some industries are vastly more important to the economic output of a particular LEP area than they are for other areas. For example, the ‘Information and communication’ sector accounted for 23% of GVA in Thames Valley Berkshire in 2012, but no more than 11% in any other LEP area. Similarly, the 'Financial and insurance activities' sector accounted for 19% of GVA in London but no more than 9% in any other LEP.\n\n<ons-table path=\"/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/articles/gvaforlocalenterprisepartnerships/2015-02-19/c168bd22\" />","title":"GVA by industry"}],"_abstract":null,"latestRelease":false,"unit":null,"dateChanges":null,"versions":null,"relatedArticles":[],"entities":{"persons":["Nottingham","Gross Disposable Household Income","Gross","Gross Trading Profits"],"organizations":["Administration","Gross Disposable Household Income","NUTS","ONS Regional GVA","Health and Education","Local Enterprise Partnerships","Regional","QMI","Capital Consumption","GVA","ONS","LEP","National Statistics","Employment Survey","Gross Trading Profits","ART Subregional Productivity \""],"dates":["December 2014","2015 - 02 - 19","May","2008 to 2013","Thursday 14","2012","2011","April 2014","year 2013","1997","2003 to 2013","December","2015","2013","2003 - 2013","2008 - 2013"],"locations":["London","England","Manchester","Birmingham"]},"relatedData":[{"uri":"/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/datasets/gvaforlocalenterprisepartnerships"}],"relatedMethodology":[],"preUnit":null},"matched_queries":["logged_featureset"]}],"max_score":0.0},"timed_out":false,"_shards":{"total":19,"successful":19,"skipped":0,"failed":0}}]
