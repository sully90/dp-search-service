Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. The data published covers January 1996 to December 2014. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the May CPI is published on 16 June 2015, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to March 2015.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each Member State of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of March 2015 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 17 April 2015. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/international/eurostat-s-data-tables.html \"Eurostat's Data Tables\"). Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/hicp/overview \"Eurostat's HICP webpage\"). \n\n3. **Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation**\n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services (139.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi-basket-of-goods-and-services/cpi-2015-basket-of-goods.pdf \"CPI 2015 Basket of Goods\") . The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights (431.9 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi--updating-weights/2015.pdf \"2015\") .\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices, which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables (2.22 Mb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/march-2015/consumer-price-inflation-reference-table.xls \"Consumer Price Inflation Reference Table\") . By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the  [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/consumer-price-indices-technical-manual--2014.pdf \"Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual, 2014\") .

The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n5. **Publication policy**\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the March 2015 data, collected on and around 17 March 2015. Future [publication dates](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/publication-dates/index.html \"Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and Retail Prices Index (RPI) publication dates\") for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2017 (the publication of the December 2016 inflation figures). Publication dates from February 2016 onwards are provisional.\n\n\tDetails of the policy governing the release of new data are available from the Media Relations Office.

The Governor shared this information with the MPC, and officials present at the MPC meeting, on Wednesday 8 April 2015. The pre-release access to the March CPI figures was extended to 4 working days from 3.5 working days due to the timing of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting being moved forward half a day.\n\n\tConsumer price inflation for April 2014 to April 2015 will be published on 19 May 2015.\n\n\tFollow us on [Twitter](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/social-media/twitter.html \"Twitter\") or join us at [Facebook](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/social-media/index.html \"Facebook\").

First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets.

This is the joint lowest 12-month rate on record alongside the rate in February 2015.\n\nOver the last 5 years, the 3 main contributors to the 12-month inflation rate have been: transport (including motor fuels); housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; and restaurants and hotels. Combined, these 3 sectors have, on average, accounted for around half of the 12-month inflation rate.\n\nIn the year to March 2015, food prices fell by 3.2% and prices of motor fuels fell by 13.7%. In both cases, the falls were smaller than in the year to February but the 2 groups still provided the largest downward contributions to the 12-month rate for March. In total, the food and motor fuels groups reduced the CPI 12-month rate by approximately 0.8 percentage points.

The 1-month movement was therefore the same in both years and this led to the CPI 12-month rate remaining at 0.0% for a second month.\n\nThe largest downward contributions to change in the CPI 12-month rate between February and March 2015 came from:\n\n- **clothing and footwear:** prices, overall, fell by 0.1% between February and March this year, compared with a rise of 1.8% between the same 2 months a year ago. This is the first time that prices have fallen between February and March since the CPI was introduced. Normally prices rise as they continue to recover following the January sales period. The downward contribution came from price movements for a range of women’s outerwear, particularly trousers, dresses and cardigans. There was also a smaller downward effect from men’s outerwear.\n\n- **housing and household services:** prices, overall, fell by 0.4% between February and March 2015 compared with a smaller fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. The downward effect came from changes in gas prices, with average bills falling by more this year than a year ago.\n\n- **restaurants and hotels:** prices, overall, rose by 0.2% between February and March this year compared with a larger rise of 0.5% a year ago.\n\nThe largest upward contributions to change in the CPI 12-month rate between February and March 2015 came from:\n\n- **transport:** prices, overall, rose by 0.7% between February and March 2015 but were little changed between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward contribution came principally from motor fuels. Average petrol prices rose by 3.8 pence per litre between February and March this year compared with no change between the same 2 months a year ago. Diesel prices also rose this year by 3.5 pence per litre but fell by 0.4 pence per litre a year ago.\n\n- **food and non-alcoholic beverages:** prices, overall, fell by 0.2% between February and March 2015, compared with a larger fall of 0.5% between the same 2 months a year earlier. Small upward effects came from 4 product groups: milk, cheese and eggs; vegetables; sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery; and mineral waters, soft drinks and juices. These were partially offset by small downward contributions from meat and fruit.\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.

These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index. CPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn March 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between March 2014 and March 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.3%, unchanged from February. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in March 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in February, despite a small upward contribution from rising owner occupiers’ housing costs.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The [full assessment report](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/stats-authority/uk-statistics-authority--assessment-246-rpi.html \"UK Statistics Authority: Assessment 246 RPI\") can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.**\n\nThe RPI is a long-standing measure of UK inflation that has historically been used for a wide range of purposes such as the indexation of pensions, rents and index-linked gilts. For further information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/users-and-uses-of-the-consumer-price-inflation-statistics.pdf \"Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics\") .\n\nRPIJ is an improved variant of the Retail Prices Index, which is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn March 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.3%, down from 0.4% in the year to February 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for March 2015 stood at 0.9%, meaning that it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period, the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 35.0% over the 10-year period, compared with 28.0% as measured by RPIJ. The use of the Carli formula has therefore added 7.0 percentage points to the change in prices over the last 10 years. A larger version of the chart can be viewed by clicking on it (HTML version only).\n\nTable C shows the RPI and RPIJ 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/2015-04-14/d1595012\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/2015-04-14/8d54c81f\" />\n\nFor users who want to understand the causes of the difference between the CPI and RPI, please see Table 5 in the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables (2.22 Mb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/march-2015/consumer-price-inflation-reference-table.xls \"Consumer Price Inflation Reference Table\") of the March release.  \n",

              "markdown": "1. **News**\n\n\tThe UK Statistics Authority launched a [public consultation](http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/consultations/index.html \"Consultations\") on consumer price statistics on 15 June. The consultation follows [a recent review of consumer price statistics](http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/current-reviews/range-of-prices-statistics.html \"UK Consumer Price Statistics: A Review\") led by Mr Paul Johnson (Director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies) and seeks users' views on the issues raised in that review. During the consultation period, the Authority will be hosting a series of consultation events across the UK beginning in London on 24 June. After the consultation closes on 15 September, the Authority will summarise the responses and publish a report.\n\n\tOn 11 June, we published historic estimates of [CPIH covering the period 1988 to 2004](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/cpih-historical-series--1988---2004-/index.html \"CPIH historical series (1988 - 2004)\") based on existing CPI data. Due to data limitations, these estimates do not form part of the official back series, but provide users with a best available estimate of CPIH for this period.\n\n\tOn 8 June, we published [trial consumer price indices](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/experimental-consumer-price-indices-using-web-scraped-data/index.html \"Trial consumer price indices using web scraped data\") constructed purely from price quotes that have been scraped from the web.  Web scraping is a tool for extracting information from the underlying HTML code of websites. We have been conducting research into these technologies and, since April 2014, have been scraping daily prices from the websites of three major retailers. The indices cover 35 grocery and alcohol items, and are presented at daily, weekly, fortnightly and monthly frequencies. The indices are accompanied by an explanatory methodological note and a brief overview of the project. \n\n2. **Understanding and accessing the data**\n\n\tA full description of how consumer price indices are compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/consumer-price-indices-technical-manual--2014.pdf \"Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual, 2014\") . This is supplemented by video, infographics and textual information available from the [guidance and methodology section](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/economy/consumer-price-indices/index.html \"Consumer Price Indices\") of our website.\n\n\tA more detailed [quality report (141.9 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/quality-information/economic-statistics/summary-quality-report-for-cpi.pdf \"Quality and Methodology Information for Consumer Price Indices\")  for this statistical bulletin is available. The report assesses consumer price inflation statistics against standard dimensions of quality such as relevance, accuracy and accessibility. The report was last updated in October 2013.\n\n\tThe [mini Triennial Review (1.75 Mb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/triennial-reviews/triennial-review-of-the-consumer-prices-index-and-retail-prices-index-central-collection-of-prices-2012.pdf \"Triennial Review of the Consumer Prices Index and Retail Prices Index central collection of prices 2012\")  of the CPI and RPI Central Collection of Prices is available.\n\n\tThe most efficient way to access the latest consumer price inflation data and briefing on our website is via the CPI key figure on the [homepage](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html \"Office for National Statistics\").\n\n\tIn response to user feedback, all consumer price inflation data are available in 1 location. The [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables (2.49 Mb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/may-2015/ref-table-cpi.xls \"Consumer Price Indices: May 2015\") are provided via an Excel file.\n\n\tTo help users further, very detailed CPI data are now available including the [individual price quotes and item indices](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi-item-indices-and-price-quotes/index.html \"Consumer Price Indices (CPI) and Retail Prices Index (RPI) item indices and price quotes\") that underpin the CPI. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. Previously the data published covered January 1996 to December 2014. The data for January to March 2015 are also now available. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the August CPI is published on 15 September 2015, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to June 2015.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each Member State of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU Member States. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of May 2015 for EU Member States, together with an EU average, on 17 June 2015. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/international/eurostat-s-data-tables.html \"Eurostat's Data Tables\"). Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU Member States is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/hicp/overview \"Eurostat HICP\"). \n\n3. **Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation**\n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services (139.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi-basket-of-goods-and-services/cpi-2015-basket-of-goods.pdf \"CPI 2015 Basket of Goods\") . The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights (431.9 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi--updating-weights/2015.pdf \"Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights\") .\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables (2.49 Mb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/may-2015/ref-table-cpi.xls \"REF Table CPI\") . By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/consumer-price-indices-technical-manual--2014.pdf \"Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual, 2014\") .

Revisions policy\n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, a [revisions policy (49.6 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/consumer-price-inflation-revisions-policy-october-2013.pdf \"Consumer Price Inflation Revisions Policy October 2013\")  was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published. \n\n5. **Publication policy**\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the May 2015 data, collected on and around 12 May 2015.

Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWIIzIw45Do \"YouTube video\") and an [infographic](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/infographics/how-cpi-is-calculated/index.html \"How is the Consumer Prices Index calculated?\") explain how consumer price inflation is calculated.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to May 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between May 2014 and May 2015.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published. [A tale of many price indices](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/december-2012/sty-a-tale-of-many-price-indices.html \"A tale of many price indices\") summarises information on the different measures.\n",

First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets.

This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in May 2014 would have cost £100.10 in May 2015. This continues the trend of the latest few months when inflation has been around 0.0%.\n\nIn the year to May 2015, food prices fell by 1.8% and prices of motor fuels fell by 11.0%. In both cases, the falls are smaller than in the year to April but along with audio-visual and related equipment they provided the largest downward contributions to the 12-month rate for May. In total, the food and motor fuels groups reduced the CPI 12-month rate by approximately 0.5 percentage points. An article was published in November 2014 which outlined some [possible factors that may be affecting prices (477.2 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/what-is-affecting-prices-in-the-uk-in-2014-.pdf \"What is affecting prices in the UK in 2014?\").\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in May 2015 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.

The 1-month movement was therefore 0.3 percentage points higher this year compared with a year ago, resulting in a rise in the CPI 12-month rate. The difference between the movements in the annual and monthly rates is due to rounding.\n\nThe largest upward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between April and May 2015 came from:\n\n- **transport:** prices, overall, rose by 0.6% between April and May 2015, compared with a fall of 0.7% a year earlier. The majority of the upward contribution came from transport services, particularly air transport where fares rose this year but fell a year ago. Changes in fares between April and May vary notably year on year, with the timing of Easter a likely factor in the movements. There was also a significant upward effect from motor fuels with average petrol prices rising by 2.5 pence per litre between April and May this year compared with a smaller rise of 0.4 pence per litre a year earlier. Diesel prices also rose this year, by 1.5 pence per litre, compared with a rise of 0.3 pence per litre a year ago. \n\n- **food and non-alcoholic beverages:** prices, overall, fell slightly by 0.1% between April and May this year but by a larger 1.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward effect came from a variety of product groups, most notably vegetables, bread and cereals, and sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery. \n\nThere was a smaller upward contribution from price movements for clothing and footwear where prices rose this year but fell a year ago, particularly for women’s outerwear.\n\nThe largest downward contribution to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between April and May 2015 came from:\n\n- **recreation and culture:** prices, overall, fell by 0.1% between April and May 2015, compared with a rise of 0.4% between the same 2 months a year ago. The downward effects came principally from games, toys and hobbies (notably computer games) and data processing equipment (principally computer peripherals such as printers and routers).\n\nThere was a smaller downward contribution from price movements for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, particularly wine.\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.

These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn May 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between May 2014 and May 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.4%, up from 0.2% in April 2015. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in May 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in April, despite a small downward contribution from owner occupiers’ housing costs.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the official CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ\n\nIn May 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.4%, up from 0.3% in the year to April 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for May 2015 stood at 1.0%, meaning that it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 34.6% over the 10-year period, compared with 27.7% as measured by RPIJ. The use of the Carli formula has therefore added 6.9 percentage points to the change in prices over the last 10 years.

Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][14].\n\n3. **Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation**\n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services (139.4 Kb Pdf)][15]. The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights (431.9 Kb Pdf)][16].\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][17]. By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)][18]. [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][19] provides further details of how consumer price statistics are used more generally.\n\n4. **Revisions policy**\n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, a [revisions policy (49.6 Kb Pdf)][20] was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n5. **Publication policy**\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the August 2015 data, collected on and around 11 August 2015. Future [publication dates][21] for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2018 (the publication of the December 2017 inflation figures). Publication dates from February 2017 onwards are provisional.\n\n\tDetails of the policy governing the release of new data are available from our Media Relations Office. Also available is a list of the names of those given [pre-release access][22] to the contents of this release.\n\n\tIn line with the Consumer Price Inflation Pre-Release arrangements, an advanced estimate of the CPI was provided to the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer 4 working days ahead of publication. The Governor shared this information with the MPC, and officials present at the MPC meeting, on Wednesday 9 September 2015. The pre-release access to the August CPI figures was extended to 4 working days from 3.5 working days due to the timing of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting being moved forward half a day.\n\n\tConsumer price inflation for September 2014 to September 2015 will be published on 13 October 2015.\n\n\tFollow us on [Twitter][23] or join us at [Facebook][24].\n\n\tMedia contact: <br>\n\tTel:  Luke Croydon   + 44 (0) 845 6041858 <br>\n\tOut of hours media line   + 44 (0) 7867 906553 <br>\n\tEmail:  <media.relations@ons.gsi.gov.uk>\n\n\tConsumer Price Inflation recorded message (available after 9.45am on release day): <br>\n\tTel: + 44 (0) 800 0113703\n\n\tConsumer Price Inflation Enquiries: <br>\n\tTel: + 44 (0) 1633 456900\n\n6.

Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. An [infographic][1] explains how consumer price inflation is calculated. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to August 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between August 2014 and August 2015.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

              "markdown": "###What is the CPI?\n\nThe CPI is a measure of consumer price inflation produced to international standards and in line with European regulations. First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf).][1]\n\n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between August 2014 and August 2015 stood at 0.0%. This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in August 2014 would have still cost £100.00 in August 2015. This continues the trend of the previous 6 months when inflation had been at or around 0.0%.\n\nIn the year to August 2015, food prices fell by 2.8% and prices of motor fuels fell by 12.9%. These 2 groups have provided some of the largest downward contributions to the 12-month rate during 2015. In August 2015, the food and motor fuels groups in total reduced the CPI 12-month rate by approximately 0.7 percentage points. Historically, price movements for these products have been among the main causes of inflation. An article was published in November 2014 which outlined some [possible factors that may be affecting prices (477.2 Kb Pdf)][2].\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in August 2015 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.

An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. [Explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (37.1 Kb Pdf)][3] is a diagram explaining the calculation.\n\nThe CPI rose by 0.2% between July and August 2015 compared with a larger rise of 0.4% between the same 2 months a year earlier. The 1-month movement was therefore 0.2 percentage points lower this year compared with a year ago, resulting in a fall in the CPI 12-month rate. The difference between the movements in the annual and monthly rates is due to rounding.\n\nThe largest downward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between July and August 2015 came from:\n\n- **transport**: prices, overall, rose by 0.1% between July and August this year compared with a larger rise of 0.8% between the same 2 months a year ago. Within transport, the largest downward contribution came from motor fuels, with diesel prices falling by 6.2 pence per litre this year compared with a fall of 2.1 pence per litre a year ago. Petrol prices also fell this year, by 2.4 pence per litre compared with a fall of 1.8 pence per litre a year ago. There was a large downward contribution from sea transport, with fares rising by less than a year ago. These effects were partially offset by a small upward contribution from air fares, which rose by more than a year ago, particularly on long-haul routes.\n\n- **clothing and footwear**: prices, overall, rose by 1.5% between July and August this year compared with a rise of 2.6% between the same 2 months a year ago. Prices of clothing and footwear usually rise between July and August as autumn ranges start to enter the shops following the summer sales season. The smaller rise this year follows a sales period in which prices fell by less than a year ago. The downward contribution came from price movements across a range of garments but particularly from women’s outerwear.\n\n- **recreation and culture**: prices, overall, fell by 0.4% between July and August this year compared with a fall of 0.1% a year ago. The downward contribution came from a range of sectors, most notably books and cultural services.\n\nThe largest upward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between July and August 2015 came from:\n\n- **furniture, household equipment and maintenance**: prices, overall, rose by 1.7% between July and August this year compared with a rise of 1.0% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward effect came principally from price rises for furniture and furnishings.\n\n- **food and non-alcoholic beverages**: prices, overall, were little changed between July and August this year compared with a fall of 0.2% a year ago. The upward contribution came from price movements for mineral waters, soft drinks and juices and, to a lesser extent, milk, cheese and eggs. These were partially offset by downward effects from bread and cereals, and meat.\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.

[Full details][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website and in an [explanatory note (313.9 Kb Pdf)][2] on our website. The improvements from the resulting development work were introduced as part of the February 2015 dataset with the historical series revised back to 2005. Further information on the changes is available in 2 articles: [Improvements to the measurement of Owner Occupiers’ Housing Costs and Private Housing Rental Prices (2.48 Mb Pdf)][3]  and [Revising the weight of Owner Occupiers’ Housing in CPIH (197.4 Kb Pdf).][4]**\n\nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn August 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between August 2014 and August 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.3%, down from 0.4% in July 2015. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in August 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in July. Owner occupiers’ housing costs increased by 0.2% between July and August 2015, the same as between these months a year earlier. This meant it had a negligible impact on the change in the CPIH 12-month rate between the 2 months.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the official CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The [full assessment report][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.**\n\nThe RPI is a long-standing measure of UK inflation that has historically been used for a wide range of purposes such as the indexation of pensions, rents and index-linked gilts. For further information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][2] \n\nRPIJ is an improved variant of the Retail Prices Index, which is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn August 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.5%, up from 0.4% in the year to July 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for August 2015 stood at 1.1%, meaning that it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 34.9% over the 10-year period, compared with 27.8% as measured by RPIJ.

We are currently going through the responses to summarise the views raised. This will be published in a response to the consultation by early December. The Authority Board will consider these responses carefully before issuing its final response in the first part of 2016.\n\n\t**Development of a single, official house price index – progress update** \n\n\tWe are working with a number of other Government departments to develop a single official house price index that makes best use of relevant data sources across the public sector. An update on progress is included in our latest [House Price Index bulletin](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/hpi/house-price-index/august-2015/stb-hpi-august-2015.html \"House Price Index\").\n\n2. **Understanding and accessing the data** \n\n\tA full description of how consumer price indices are compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/consumer-price-indices-technical-manual--2014.pdf \"Consumer Prime Indices Technical Manual, 2014\"). This is supplemented by infographics and textual information available from the [guidance and methodology section](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/economy/consumer-price-indices/index.html \"Consumer Price Indices\") of our website.\n\n\tA more detailed [quality report (141.9 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/quality-information/economic-statistics/summary-quality-report-for-cpi.pdf \"Summary quality report for CPI\") for this statistical bulletin is available. The report assesses consumer price inflation statistics against standard dimensions of quality such as relevance, accuracy and accessibility. The report was last updated in October 2013.\n\t\n\tThe [mini Triennial Review (1.75 Mb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/triennial-reviews/triennial-review-of-the-consumer-prices-index-and-retail-prices-index-central-collection-of-prices-2012.pdf \"Report on the Triennial Review of the Consumer Prices Index and Retail Prices Index Central Collection of Prices\") of the CPI and RPI Central Collection of Prices is available.\n\n\tThe most efficient way to access the latest consumer price inflation data and briefing on our website is via the CPI key figure on the [homepage](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html \"Office for National Statistics\").\n\n\tIn response to user feedback, all consumer price inflation data are available in 1 location. The [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm:77-323657 \"Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables\") are provided via an Excel file.\n\n\tTo help users further, very detailed CPI data are now available including the [individual price quotes and item indices](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi-item-indices-and-price-quotes/index.html \"Consumer Price Indices (CPI) and Retail Prices Index (RPI) item indices and price quotes\") that underpin the CPI. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. The data published covers January 1996 to June 2015. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the November CPI is published on 15 December 2015, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to September 2015.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each member state of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of September 2015 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 16 September 2015. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&language=en&pcode=teicp000&tableSelection=1&plugin=1 \"HICP - all items\"). Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU member states is available from Eurostat's HICP web page.\n\n3. **Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation** \n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services (139.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi-basket-of-goods-and-services/cpi-2015-basket-of-goods.pdf \"CPI 2015 Basket of Goods\"). The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights (431.9 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi--updating-weights/2015.pdf \"Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights\").\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from Tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm:77-323657 \"Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables\"). By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/consumer-price-indices-technical-manual--2014.pdf \"Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual, 2014\").

The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n5. **Publication policy** \n\n\tThis bulletin includes the September 2015 data, collected on and around 8 September 2015.

Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. An [infographic](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/infographics/how-cpi-is-calculated/index.html \"How CPI is calculated\") explains how consumer price inflation is calculated. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to September 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between September 2014 and September 2015.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/users-and-uses-of-the-consumer-price-inflation-statistics.pdf \"Users and uses of Consumer Price Inflation statistics\").\n\n### Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between September 2014 and September 2015 stood at a negative 0.1%. This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in September 2014 would have cost £99.90 in September 2015. This continues the trend of most of 2015 when inflation had been at or around 0.0%.\n\nIn the year to September 2015, food prices fell by 2.5% and prices of motor fuels fell by 14.9%. These 2 groups have provided some of the largest downward contributions to the 12-month rate during 2015. In September 2015, the food and motor fuels groups in total reduced the CPI 12-month rate by approximately 0.8 percentage points. Historically, price movements for these products have been among the main causes of inflation. An article was published in November 2014 which outlined some [possible factors that may be affecting prices (477.2 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/what-is-affecting-prices-in-the-uk-in-2014-.pdf \"What is affecting prices in the UK in 2014?\").\n\nThe CPI can be divided into goods and services components. The 12-month rate for the former stood at a negative 2.4%, while the latter stood at a positive 2.5%. Over the last 25 years, goods inflation has generally been lower than services inflation. The gap between the two has widened noticeably over the last year, from 2.2 percentage points in the year to September 2014 to 4.9 percentage points in the year to September 2015 – the largest gap since April 2003. The impact of factory gate and raw material prices will likely have a larger impact on the price of goods, whereas wages and property costs could be larger factors for services.\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in September 2015 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.

An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. [Explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (37.1 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/explaining-the-contributions-to-change-in-12-month-rate.pdf \"Explaining the contributions to change in 12-month rate\") is a diagram explaining the calculation.\n\nThe CPI fell by 0.1% between August and September 2015 compared with a negligible change between the same 2 months a year earlier. This is the first time that the CPI has fallen between August and September.\n\nThe largest downward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between August and September 2015 came from:\n\n- **clothing and footwear**: prices, overall, rose by 2.8% between August and September this year compared with a larger rise of 4.0% between the same 2 months a year ago. As prices rose by less than a year ago, this resulted in a downward contribution to the CPI 12-month rate. Clothing prices, overall, always rise between August and September. However, this was the weakest growth since 2008, with a higher proportion of clothing items on sale in September 2015 when compared with September last year. Taking the summer (May to September) as a whole, clothing and footwear prices increased by 0.4% compared with larger increases of 0.9% and 1.2% over the same period in 2013 and 2014 respectively\n\n- **fuels and lubricants (part of the \"transport\" category)**: prices, overall, fell by 2.9% between August and September this year compared with a smaller fall of 0.6% between the same 2 months a year ago. The largest downward contribution came from petrol, with prices falling by 3.7 pence per litre between August and September this year compared with a fall of 0.8 pence per litre between the same 2 months a year ago. Diesel prices are now at their lowest level since December 2009, standing at 110.2 pence per litre\n\n- **gas (part of the \"housing and household services\" category)**: prices, overall, fell by 2.1% between August and September this year, compared with no change between the same 2 months a year ago, with price reductions from a major supplier\n\nThere were no notable upward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between August and September 2015.\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.

These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn September 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between September 2014 and September 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.2%, down from 0.3% in August 2015. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in September 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in August. Owner occupiers’ housing costs increased by 0.1% between August and September 2015, the same as between these months a year earlier. This meant it had a negligible impact on the change in the CPIH 12-month rate between the 2 months.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the official CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The [full assessment report](http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/assessment/assessment/assessment-reports/assessment-report-246---the-retail-prices-index.pdf \"Assessment Report 246 - The Retail Price Index\") can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.**\n\nThe RPI is a long-standing measure of UK inflation that has historically been used for a wide range of purposes such as the indexation of pensions, rents and index-linked gilts. For further information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/users-and-uses-of-the-consumer-price-inflation-statistics.pdf \"Users and uses of the Consumer Price Inflation statistics\").\n\nRPIJ is an improved variant of the Retail Prices Index, which is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn September 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.1%, down from 0.5% in the year to August 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for September 2015 stood at 0.8%, meaning that it was 0.7 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 34.4% over the 10-year period, compared with 27.4% as measured by RPIJ. The use of the Carli formula has therefore added 7.0 percentage points to the change in prices over the last 10 years. A larger version of the chart can be viewed by clicking on it (HTML version only).\n\nTable C shows the RPI and RPIJ 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/2015-10-13/6559f0c0\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/2015-10-13/336334bd\" />\n\nFor users who want to understand the causes of the difference between the CPI and RPI, please see Table 5 in the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm:77-323657 \"Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables\") of the September 2015 release.",

              "markdown": "1. ###News\n\n\t**Advisory Panels for Consumer Price Statistics**\n\n\tIn June 2015 the UK Statistics Authority announced the formation of 2 independent advisory panels on consumer price statistics: a technical panel to advise the National Statistician on technical aspects of the statistics; and a stakeholder panel to provide advice on the uses and applications of price indices. The announcement followed a review, led by Professor Sir Adrian Smith, which considered matters relating to the governance arrangements and structures underpinning the production of consumer price statistics.\n\n\tOn 27 November, the 2 panels met for the first time in a joint session. [Minutes and papers][1] were published on 14 December on our website. The panels will meet again on 22 January 2016.\n\n\t**Re-referencing of CPI and CPIH indices**\n\n\tFrom the release of January consumer price inflation data in February 2016, CPI and CPIH indices will be re-referenced and published with 2015=100. Regular re-referencing of indices is methodological good practice as it avoids rounding issues that can arise from small index values. Published CPI and CPIH inflation rates are calculated from unrounded indices, meaning that re-referencing will not impact on published inflation rates. Re-referencing will result in revisions to the CPI and CPIH indices. Full back series for each of the revised indices will be published shortly before publication of the January data. Re-referencing does not impact on RPI and RPIJ. Further details will be included in future CPI statistical bulletins. For more information please contact <cpi@ons.gsi.gov.uk>.\n\n\t**Correspondence with the Bank of England**\n\n\tSection 21 of the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 requires that, prior to making any change to the coverage or the basic calculation of the RPI, the UK Statistics Authority must consult the Bank of England as to whether any proposed change constitutes a fundamental change in the index which would be materially detrimental to the interests of the holders of relevant index-linked gilt edged securities. On 17 November 2015, ONS informed the Bank of England of the annual update to the basket of RPI items, and a review of the location boundaries wherein prices are collected. On 17 December 2015, the Bank concluded that these changes neither constituted a fundamental change in the index and nor was it likely to be materially detrimental to the holders of index-linked gilts.\n\n2. ###Understanding and accessing the data\n\n\tA full description of how consumer price indices are compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][2] (674.4 Kb Pdf). This is supplemented by infographics and textual information available from the [guidance and methodology][3] section of our website.\n\n\tA more detailed [quality report][4] (141.9 Kb Pdf) for this statistical bulletin is available. The report assesses consumer price inflation statistics against standard dimensions of quality such as relevance, accuracy and accessibility. The report was last updated in October 2013.\n\n\tThe mini [Triennial Review][5] (1.75 Mb Pdf) of the CPI and RPI Central Collection of Prices is available.\n\n\tThe most efficient way to access the latest consumer price inflation data and briefing on our website is via the CPI key figure on the homepage.\n\n\tIn response to user feedback, all consumer price inflation data are available in 1 location. The [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][6] are provided via an Excel file.\n\n\tTo help users further, very detailed CPI data are now available including the [individual price quotes and item indices][7] that underpin the CPI. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. The data published covers January 1996 to September 2015. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the February CPI is published on 22 March 2016, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to December 2015.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each member state of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of December 2015 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 19 January 2016. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables][8]. Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][9].\n\n3. ###Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation\n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services][10] (139.4 Kb Pdf). The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights][11] (431.9 Kb Pdf).\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][12]. By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][13] (674.4 Kb Pdf). [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics][14] (100.5 Kb Pdf) provides further details of how consumer price statistics are used more generally.\n\n4. ###Revisions policy\n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, a [revisions policy][15] (49.6 Kb Pdf) was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n5. ###Publication policy\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the December 2015 data, collected on and around 15 December 2015. Future [publication dates][16] for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2018 (the publication of the December 2017 inflation figures). Publication dates from February 2017 onwards are provisional.\n\n\tDetails of the policy governing the release of new data are available from our Media Relations Office.

Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. An [infographic explains how consumer price inflation is calculated][1]. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to December 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between December 2014 and December 2015.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published. [A tale of many price indices][2] summarises information on the different measures.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/infographics/how-cpi-is-calculated/index.html \"How CPI is calculated\"\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/december-2012/sty-a-tale-of-many-price-indices.html \" A tale of many price indices\"",

              "markdown": "### What is the CPI?\n\nThe CPI is a measure of consumer price inflation produced to international standards and in line with European regulations. First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][1].\n\n### Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between December 2014 and December 2015 stood at 0.2%, a small increase compared with November 2015, when the rate was 0.1%. Although this is the first month since January 2015 for which the rate has exceeded 0.1%, this continues the trend since early 2015 of the rate being very close to zero. A rate of 0.2% means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in December 2014 would have cost £100.20 in December 2015.\n\nAs the rate has been very close to zero since early 2015, taken as a whole, households have experienced very little change in prices compared with the same months in 2014. Looking across the year overall, prices for transport costs, food and non-alcoholic beverages and (to a lesser extent) recreational and cultural goods and services have had a downward pull on the rate of inflation. These have been counterbalanced by an upward pull from price movements for other goods and services, most notably restaurant and hotel bills, and education costs such as university tuition fees.\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in December 2015 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.

An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. [Explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (37.1 Kb Pdf)][2] is a diagram explaining the calculation.\n\nThe CPI increased by 0.1% between November and December 2015, having been unchanged between the same 2 months a year earlier. The 1-month movement was therefore 0.1 percentage points higher this year compared with a year ago, leading to a rise in the CPI 12-month rate.\n\nBetween November and December 2015, the only substantial upward contribution to the change in the CPI 12-month rate came from:\n\n- transport: prices, overall, increased by 1.8% between November and December this year, compared with a fall of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward effect on the change in the 12-month rate came principally from air fares and to a lesser extent motor fuels. Air fares increased by 46% between November and December 2015 compared with 19% between the same 2 months a year earlier. This is the largest November to December price increase since 2002, although it is important to note that air fare prices are highly variable. November to December rises in excess of 40% were also seen in 2009 to 2011. Motor fuel prices fell by less than they did a year ago, meaning that they had an upward contribution to the change in the 12-month rate. Petrol prices fell by 3.4 pence per litre this year compared with a larger fall of 6.1 pence a year ago, while diesel fell by 2.3 pence this year compared with 4.8 pence a year ago\n\nThe largest downward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between November and December 2015 came from:\n\n- food and non-alcoholic beverages: prices, overall, fell by 0.2% between November and December this year, compared with a rise of 0.3% between the same 2 months a year ago. Price changes for cauliflower and potato crisps had the largest downward contribution to the change in the 12-month rate\n\n- alcoholic beverages and tobacco: prices, overall, fell by 1.3%, compared with a smaller fall of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year earlier. Wine and spirits were the main contributors to the change in the 12-month rate, with both showing larger price drops than in the same period a year ago\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.

              "markdown": "CPIH is currently undergoing re-assessment to evaluate the extent to which it meets the professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics. CPIH was first assessed in 2013. In August 2014 its National Statistics status was removed pending work to improve the methods for measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs in the index. [Full details][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website and in an [explanatory note][2] (313.9 Kb Pdf) on our website. The improvements from the resulting development work were introduced as part of the February 2015 dataset with the historical series revised back to 2005. Further information on the changes is available in 2 articles: [Improvements to the measurement of Owner Occupiers’ Housing Cost and Private Housing Rental Prices][3] (2.48 Mb Pdf) and [Revising the weight of Owner Occupiers’ Housing in CPIH][4] (197.4 Kb Pdf) .\n\nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn December 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between December 2014 and December 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.5%, up from 0.4% in November 2015. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in December 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in November 2015.\n\nOwners occupiers' housing costs increased by 0.2% between November and December 2015, the same as between these months a year earlier. This means that it had a very small impact on the change on the CPIH 12 month rate between the two months.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the official CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"f2b53064\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"c6ceb1b6\" />\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/consumer-price-indices-including-housing-costs-cpih-indicator/ \"Consumer Price Indices including Housing Costs (CPIH) Indicator\"\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpih-announcement-august-2014.pdf \"CPIH announcement August 2014\"\n  [3]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/improvements-to-the-measurement-of-owner-occupiers--housing.pdf \"Improvements to the measurement of owner occupiers’ housing costs and private housing rental prices\"\n  [4]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/revising-the-weight-of-owner-occupiers--housing-in-cpih.pdf \"Revising the weight of Owner Occupiers' Housing in CPIH\"",

The [full assessment report][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.\n\nThe RPI is a long-standing measure of UK inflation that has historically been used for a wide range of purposes such as the indexation of pensions, rents and index-linked gilts. For further information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics][2] (100.5 Kb Pdf).\n\nRPIJ is an improved variant of the Retail Prices Index, which is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn December 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.5%, up from 0.3% in the year to November 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for December 2015 stood at 1.2%, meaning that it was 0.7 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 34.3% over the 10-year period, compared with 27.2% as measured by RPIJ. The use of the Carli formula has therefore added 7.1 percentage points to the change in prices over the last 10 years.\n\nTable C shows the RPI and RPIJ 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"be0b2fce\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"c19bcfee\" />\n\nFor users who want to understand the causes of the difference between the CPI and RPI, please see Table 5 in the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][3].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/the-retail-prices-index/ \"The Retail Price Index\"\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/users-and-uses-of-the-consumer-price-inflation-statistics.pdf \"Users and uses of the consumer price inflation statistics\"\n  [3]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-323669 \"Consumer Price Inflation, December 2015 Reference Tables\"",

This change is being introduced as a result of the implementation of the new [UK House Price Index (UK HPI)][2] on 14 June 2016. The former ONS/DCLG HPI is currently used in RPI in the calculation of some housing components, namely mortgage interest payments, estate agents fees, ground rent and house depreciation. From March this will be replaced by a variant of the new UK HPI (calculated using an arithmetic mean rather than a geometric mean). For more information please see the exchange of letters between [ourselves][3] and the [Bank of England][4]. \n\n2. ###Revisions policy\n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, a [revisions policy][5] was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n3. ###Publication policy\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the January 2017 data, collected on and around 10 January 2017. Future [publication dates][6] for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2019 (the publication of the December 2018 inflation figures). Publication dates from February 2018 onwards are provisional.\n\n\tConsumer price inflation for February 2016 to February 2017 will be published on 21 March 2017.\n\n4. ###Recorded message\n\n\tConsumer price inflation recorded message (available after 9.45am on release day): \n\n\tTelephone: + 44 (0) 800 0113703\n\n5. ###Code of Practice\n\n\t[National Statistics][7] are produced to high professional standards set out in the [Code of Practice for Official Statistics][8]. They undergo regular quality assurance reviews to ensure that they meet customer needs. They are produced free from any political interference and released according to the arrangements approved by the [UK Statistics Authority][9].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/qualityassuranceofadministrativedatausedincpih\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/housepriceindex/dec2016\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk//economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/notificationofproposedchangestorpiin2017\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/bankofenglandresponsetoproposedchangestorpiin2017\n  [5]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/releasecalendar?query=UK%20consumer%20price%20inflation&fromDateDay=&fromDateMonth=&fromDateYear=&toDateDay=31&toDateMonth=1&toDateYear=2019&view=upcoming&size=10\n  [7]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/national-statistician/types-of-official-statistics/\n  [8]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/monitoring-and-assessment/code-of-practice/\n  [9]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/",

A way to understand this is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. Movements in price indices represent the changing cost of this basket. An [infographic][1] explains how consumer price inflation is calculated, and [Consumer price indices – a brief guide][2] gives an overview of the indices and their uses. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to January 2017, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between January 2016 and January 2017.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

              "markdown": "###What is the CPI?\n\nThe CPI is a measure of consumer price inflation produced to international standards and in line with European regulations. First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics][1].\n\n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between January 2016 and January 2017 stood at 1.8%. This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in January 2016 would have cost £101.80 in January 2017.\n\nThe January 2017 rate of 1.8% is an increase on the December 2016 figure and is the highest since June 2014 when it was 1.9%. At that time, the rate began to fall, subsequently remaining at or around zero for much of 2015 before gradually picking up from the end of the year and throughout 2016.\n\nThe strong downward pull on inflation seen in recent years for prices for food has lessened considerably over the last 4 months. The 12-month inflation rate for food stood at negative 0.4% in January 2017, the highest since June 2014. Transport prices continue to provide the strongest upward pressure.\n\n[Prices economic commentary: Feb 2017][2], also published today, presents further analysis of the latest CPI, Producer Price Index (PPI), House Price Index (HPI), construction output price indices (OPIs) and Index of Private Housing Rental Prices (IPHRP) results and emerging trends.\n\nFigure 1 shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in January 2017 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"8c77daa1\" />\n\nFigure 2 shows the CPI 12-month rate for the last 10 years. Table 1 shows the CPI 1-month rate (the amount prices change between 2 consecutive months), 12-month rate and index values for the last year.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"821b3a21\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"073dfbeb\" />\n\n###Consumer Prices Index (CPI): What are the main movements?\n\nThis section explains which goods and services had the biggest impact on the change to the 12-month rate between December 2016 and January 2017 and, where relevant, considers the longer-term inflationary trends for these goods and services.\n\nThe change in the CPI 12-month rate can be calculated by comparing the 12-month rates for 2 consecutive months. An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. [Explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (2013)][3] is a diagram explaining the calculation.\n\nThe CPI fell by 0.5% between December 2016 and January 2017, compared with a larger fall of 0.8% between the same 2 months a year earlier. This led to a rise in the CPI 12-month rate.\n\nThe main upward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between December 2016 and January 2017 came from the following groups:\n\nTransport: prices, overall, fell by 0.6% between December 2016 and January 2017, compared with a larger fall of 2.5% a year ago. Within transport, the largest upward effect came from motor fuels, with prices rising by 3.4% between December 2016 and January 2017, having fallen by 2.6% a year earlier. This continues the trend of increasing fuel prices seen since early 2016, reflecting movements in oil prices. Transport services, notably transport by air, road and rail, also contributed to the increase in the rate, as collectively prices fell by less than they did a year ago.\n\nFood and non-alcoholic beverages: the upward effect came from a wide range of food products, with prices for food overall being unchanged between December 2016 and January 2017, having fallen by 0.6% a year ago. Following a sustained period of deflation of food prices since mid-2014, during which the 12-month rate was often lower than negative 3.0%, the rate has increased for 4 consecutive months, reaching negative 0.4% in January 2017. This is the highest it has been since June 2014. [Prices economic commentary: Feb 2017][2] presents further analysis.\n\nThe main downward contribution to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between December 2016 and January 2017 came from:\n\nClothing and footwear: the downward effect was due to prices for a wide range of items of clothing and footwear. Overall, prices fell by 4.2% between December 2016 and January 2017, compared with a smaller fall of 3.1% last year. Sales patterns may have contributed to this, as the proportion of items on sale increased by more between December 2016 and January 2017 than it did a year ago. \n\nFigure 3 shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"9f19e5c2\" />\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/usersandusesofconsumerpriceinflationstatistics\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/priceseconomiccommentary/feb2017\n  [3]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html",

The report includes a number of requirements that need to be implemented for CPIH to regain its status as a National Statistic. The actions taken to address these requirements were reported to the UK Statistics Authority at the end of September 2016.\n\nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index. The [CPIH compendium][3] provides further information, including the rationale for the choice of methodology for measuring OOH, which is still extensively debated. We also publish data for alternative measures of OOH on a quarterly basis alongside the article [Understanding the different approaches of measuring owner occupiers' housing costs][4].\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words, this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable as a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage, the basket of goods and services and the method of deriving the weights are the same as for the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. A full description of how CPIH is compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][5] and the [CPIH compendium][6].\n\nIn January 2017, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between January 2016 and January 2017) for CPIH stood at 2.0%, up from 1.7% in December 2016. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in January 2017 was 0.2 percentage points, up from 0.1 percentage points in December 2016. \n\nFigure 4 shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates for the last 10 years. The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table 2 shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

For further information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics][2].\n\nRPIJ is a variant of the RPI and is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between these indices.

HICPs are calculated in each member state of the European Union (EU) according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of January 2017 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 22 February 2017. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables][7]. Further information on HICP for the EU, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][8].\n\n###Methods – CPI and other measures of inflation\n\nThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\nThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2016 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation Basket of Goods and Services: 2016][9]. The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2016 are available in an article published on 22 March 2016 entitled [Consumer Prices Index and Retail Prices Index – updating weights][10].\n\nRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from Tables 63 and 64 of the [Consumer Price Inflation dataset][11]. By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\nFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index, can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][12]. [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics][13] provides further details of how consumer price statistics are used more generally.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/qmis/consumerpriceinflationqmi\n  [2]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/index.html\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/topicspecificmethodology\n  [4]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/triennial-reviews/index.html\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/feb2016/relateddata\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceindicescpiandretailpricesindexrpiitemindicesandpricequotes\n  [7]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&language=en&pcode=teicp000&tableSelection=1&plugin=1\n  [8]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/hicp/overview\n  [9]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/consumerpriceinflationbasketofgoodsandservices/2016\n  [10]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/consumerpricesindexandretailpricesindexupdatingweights/2016\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceinflation\n  [12]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/index.html\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/usersandusesofconsumerpriceinflationstatistics",

              "markdown": "1. ###News\n\n\t####Household Inflation Index\n\n\tOn 9 March 2016, the UK Statistics Authority published a letter from the National Statistician to the Chair of the Authority about the future of consumer inflation statistics. In the letter, he acknowledged calls for a measure of inflation showing the effect of changes in payments for goods and services, a so-called “Household Inflation Index” (HII). This index would be fundamentally different in a number of important aspects from the traditional measurement of consumer inflation. These differences include the potential inclusion of asset prices and interest payments, as well as giving each household’s expenditure equal weight. The HII could also be a vehicle for measuring different households’ experience of changes in prices. In July/August, we will publish a discussion paper based on our early explorations into the concepts of the HII. We are keen to receive feedback from users on the paper.\n\n\t####Re-assessment of CPIH\n\n\tCPIH has been re-assessed to evaluate the extent to which it meets the professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics and the assessment report [Statistics on consumer Price Inflation including Owner Occupiers’ Housing Costs][1], published on 3 March 2016. The report includes a number of requirements that need to be implemented for CPIH to regain its status as a National Statistic. The actions taken to address these requirements will be reported to the UK Statistics Authority by September 2016.\n\n\t####Personal Inflation Calculator\n\n\tThe interactive Personal Inflation Calculator which could be used by people to calculate their personal inflation based on their spending patterns has currently been removed from the website. The facility was used by a very small number of people.\n\n2. ###Understanding and accessing the data\n\n\tA full description of how consumer price indices are compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][2]. This is supplemented by further information available from the [prices guidance and methodology webpage][3].\n\n\tA more detailed [Consumer Price Inflation Quality and Methodology report][4] for this statistical bulletin is available. The report assesses consumer price inflation statistics against standard dimensions of quality such as relevance, accuracy and accessibility. The report was last updated in October 2013.\n\n\tThe [mini Triennial Review][5] of the CPI and RPI Central Collection of Prices is available.\n\n\tAll consumer price inflation data (including Excel dataset, time series data and explorable datasets) can be found on the [Consumer Price Inflation: June 2016][6].\n\n\tTo help users further, very detailed data are available, including the [individual price quotes (for locally collected items only) and item indices][7] that underpin the consumer price inflation statistics. The item indices behind the measurement of owner occupiers’ housing costs are included for the first time in the first quarter 2016 data. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider can be identified. The data published cover January 1996 to March 2016. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the August CPI is published on 13 September 2016, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to June 2016.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each member state of the European Union (EU) according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat released figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of June 2016 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 15 July 2016. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables][8]. Further information on HICP for the EU, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][9].\n\n3. ###Methods ‒ CPI and other measures of inflation\n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2016 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation Basket of Goods and Services: 2016][10]. The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2016 are available in an article published on 22 March 2016 entitled [Consumer Price Index and Retail Prices Index – updating weights: 2016][11].\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices, which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from Tables 63 and 64 of the [Consumer Price Inflation dataset][12]. By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index, can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices technical manual][13]. [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (2013)][14] provides further details of how consumer price statistics are used more generally.\n\n4. ###Revisions policy\n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, the [Consumer price inflation revisions policy][15] was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory, though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n5. ###Publication policy\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the June 2016 data, collected on and around 14 June 2016. Future [publication dates][16] for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2018 (the publication of the December 2017 inflation figures). Publication dates from February 2017 onwards are provisional.\n\n\tConsumer price inflation for July 2015 to July 2016 will be published on 16 August 2016.\n\n6. ###Recorded message\n\n\tConsumer price inflation recorded message (available after 9.45am on release day): \n\n\tTel: + 44 (0) 800 0113703<br>\n\n7. ###Code of Practice\n\n\t[National Statistics][17] are produced to high professional standards set out in the [Code of Practice for Official Statistics][18]. They undergo regular quality assurance reviews to ensure that they meet customer needs. They are produced free from any political interference and released according to the arrangements approved by the [UK Statistics Authority][19].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/statistics-on-consumer-price-inflation-including-owner-occupiers-housing-costs/\n  [2]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/index.html\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/pricesuserguidancemethodologyanddevelopments\n  [4]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/qmis/consumerpriceinflationqmi\n  [5]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/triennial-reviews/index.html\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/june2016/relateddata\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceindicescpiandretailpricesindexrpiitemindicesandpricequotes\n  [8]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&language=en&pcode=teicp000&tableSelection=1&plugin=1\n  [9]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/hicp/overview\n  [10]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/consumerpriceinflationbasketofgoodsandservices/2016\n  [11]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/consumerpricesindexandretailpricesindexupdatingweights/2016\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceinflation\n  [13]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/index.html\n  [14]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html\n  [15]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html\n  [16]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/publication-dates/index.html\n  [17]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/national-statistician/types-of-official-statistics/\n  [18]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/monitoring-and-assessment/code-of-practice/\n  [19]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/",

First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the UK government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (2013)][1].\n\n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between June 2015 and June 2016 stood at 0.5%. This means that a basket of goods and services that would have cost £100.00 in June 2015 cost £100.50 in June 2016.\n\nThe rate is the same as observed for March and slightly above the 0.3% recorded for all other months of 2016. The rates for 2016 to date are still relatively low but are above those generally experienced in 2015, which was a year of historically low inflation, with the rate being at or around zero for much of the year. The largest downward pull on inflation in June 2016 and for 2016 to date comes from prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages. There also continues to be a downward pressure from transport prices, but this has eased during 2016 from the 2015 position. Upward pressures come from a variety of categories, most notably restaurant and hotel bills.\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in June 2016 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"1ba7e121\" />\n\nFigure B shows the CPI 12-month rate for the last 10 years. Table A shows the CPI 1-month rate (the amount prices change between 2 consecutive months), 12-month rate and index values for the last year.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"92dca899\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"446f4669\" />\n\n###Consumer Prices Index (CPI): What are the main movements?\n\nThis section explains which goods and services had the biggest impact on the change to the 12-month rate between May and June 2016 and, where relevant, considers the longer-term inflationary trends for these goods and services.\n\nThe change in the CPI 12-month rate can be calculated by comparing the 12-month rates for 2 consecutive months. An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. The diagram [explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (2013)][2] explains the calculation.\n\nThe CPI rose by 0.2% between May and June 2016, compared with a negligible change between the same 2 months a year earlier. The 1-month movement was therefore 0.2 percentage points higher this year compared with a year ago, leading to a rise in the CPI 12-month rate.\n\nBetween May and June 2016, the main upward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate came from the following groups.\n\nTransport: prices, overall, rose by 1.1% between May and June this year compared with a rise of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. Within transport, the largest upward effect came from air fares, which rose by more than a year ago, with the main contribution coming from European routes. The 10.9% rise in fares this year was the largest May to June movement on record although it is important to note that air fares are highly variable. Motor fuel prices also rose by more than a year ago, with petrol and diesel prices rising by 2.3 and 2.6 pence per litre respectively between May and June 2016. A smaller upward effect came from changes in sea transport fares, though this was offset by a downward pull from rail transport.\n\nRecreation and culture: prices, overall, rose by 0.6% this year compared with a fall of 0.1% a year ago. The upward contribution came principally from games, toys and hobbies (particularly computer games) with prices rising between May and June 2016 compared with a fall last year. Other smaller upward effects came from cultural services and books.\n\nCommunication: the upward contribution came from telephone equipment and services with prices, overall, rising by 0.6% between May and June this year compared with a fall of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. The effect came principally from mobile phone charges which fell this year but by less than a year ago.\n\nThe main downward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between May and June 2016 came from the following groups.\n\nFurniture, household equipment and maintenance: prices, overall, fell by 0.3% between May and June this year but rose by 0.3% between the same 2 months a year ago. The downward contribution came almost entirely from furniture and furnishings, particularly kitchen units.\n\nRestaurants and hotels: prices, overall, rose by 0.1% this year compared with a larger rise of 0.4% a year ago. The downward effect came from accommodation services, where prices for overnight hotel accommodation fell this year but rose a year ago.\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to the change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"83b98228\" />\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html\n  [2]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html",

The report includes a number of requirements that need to be implemented for CPIH to regain its status as a National Statistic. The actions taken to address these requirements will be reported to the UK Statistics Authority by September 2016.\n\nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words, this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 16.5% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage, the basket of goods and services and the method of deriving the weights are the same as for the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. A full description of how CPIH is compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices technical manual][2] and in various papers published on the [prices guidance and methodology webpage][3].\n\nIn June 2016, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between June 2015 and June 2016) for CPIH stood at 0.8%, up from 0.7% in May 2016. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in June 2016 was 0.3 percentage points, down from 0.4 percentage points in May. This narrowing was principally due to rounding. Owner occupiers’ housing costs increased by 0.1% between May and June 2016, the same as the movement between these months a year earlier. This meant that they had a negligible impact on the change in the CPIH 12-month rate between the 2 months.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates for the last 10 years. The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year. More CPIH data are available in Tables 21 to 34 of the [Consumer Price Inflation dataset][4].\n\n<ons-chart path=\"e908fbe9\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"fb587d2b\" />\n\n  [1]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/statistics-on-consumer-price-inflation-including-owner-occupiers-housing-costs/\n  [2]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-technical-manual/index.html\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/pricesuserguidancemethodologyanddevelopments\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceinflation",

The [full assessment report][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.\n\nThe RPI is a long-standing measure of UK inflation that has historically been used for a wide range of purposes such as the indexation of pensions, rents and index-linked gilts. For further information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (2013)][2].\n\nRPIJ is an improved variant of the RPI and is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, and so on as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series, in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn June 2016, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.9%, up from 0.7% in May.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for June 2016 stood at 1.6%, meaning that it was 0.7 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.6 percentage points lower than the RPI. \n\nTable C shows the RPI and RPIJ 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"2e694e5b\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"3e2f1063\" />\n\nIf you would like to understand the causes of the difference between the CPI and RPI, please see Table 5 in the [Consumer Price Inflation dataset][3].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/the-retail-prices-index/\n  [2]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceinflation",

The announcement followed a review, led by Professor Sir Adrian Smith, which considered matters relating to the governance arrangements and structures underpinning the production of consumer price statistics.\n\n\tOn 27 November, the 2 panels met for the first time in joint session. [Minutes and papers][1] were published on 14 December 2015 on the ONS website.\n\n\t**Measuring Consumer Prices: the options for change consultation**\n\n\tThe UK Statistics Authority [public consultation][2] on consumer price statistics closed on 15 September and a s[ummary of the responses][3] was published on 23 November on the UK Statistics Authority website. The Authority will consider these responses carefully, along with advice from its regulatory function and the newly established Advisory Panels for Consumer Price Statistics, before issuing its final response in the first half of 2016.\n\n\t**Re-referencing of CPI and CPIH indices**\n\n\tFrom the release of January consumer price inflation data in February 2016, CPI and CPIH indices will be re-referenced and published with 2015=100. Regular re-referencing of indices is methodological good practice as it avoids rounding issues that can arise from small index values. Published CPI and CPIH inflation rates are calculated from unrounded indices, meaning that re-referencing will not impact on published inflation rates. Re-referencing will result in revisions to the CPI and CPIH indices. Full back series for each of the revised indices will be published shortly before publication of the January data. Re-referencing does not impact on RPI and RPIJ. Further details will be included in future CPI statistical bulletins. For more information please contact <cpi@ons.gsi.gov.uk>.\n\n2. **Understanding and accessing the data**\n\n\tA full description of how consumer price indices are compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)][4]. This is supplemented by infographics and textual information available from the [guidance and methodology][5] section of our website.\n\n\tA [more detailed quality report (141.9 Kb Pdf)][6] for this statistical bulletin is available. The report assesses consumer price inflation statistics against standard dimensions of quality such as relevance, accuracy and accessibility. The report was last updated in October 2013.\n\n\tThe [mini Triennial Review (1.75 Mb Pdf)][7] of the CPI and RPI Central Collection of Prices is available.\n\n\tThe most efficient way to access the latest consumer price inflation data and briefing on our website is via the CPI key figure on the [homepage][8].\n\n\tIn response to user feedback, all consumer price inflation data are available in 1 location. The [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][9] are provided via an Excel file.\n\n\tTo help users further, very detailed CPI data are now available including the [individual price quotes and item indices][10] that underpin the CPI. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. Previously the data published covered January 1996 to June 2015. The data for July to September 2015 are also now available. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the February CPI is published on 22 March 2016, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to December 2015.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each member state of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of November 2015 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 16 December 2015. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables][11]. Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][12].\n\n3. **Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation**\n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services (139.4 Kb Pdf)][13]. The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights (431.9 Kb Pdf)][14].\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][15]. By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual (674.4 Kb Pdf)][16]. [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][17] provides further details of how consumer price statistics are used more generally.\n\n4. **Revisions policy**\n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, a [revisions policy (49.6 Kb Pdf)][18] was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n5. **Publication policy**\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the November 2015 data, collected on and around 10 November 2015. Future [publication dates][19] for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2018 (the publication of the December 2017 inflation figures). Publication dates from February 2017 onwards are provisional.\n\n\tDetails of the policy governing the release of new data are available from our Media Relations Office. Also available is a list of the names of those given [pre-release access][20] to the contents of this release.\n\n\tIn line with the Consumer Price Inflation Pre-Release arrangements, an advanced estimate of the CPI was provided to the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer 4 working days ahead of publication. The Governor shared this information with the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and officials present at the MPC meeting, on Wednesday 9 December 2015.

Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. An [infographic][1] explains how consumer price inflation is calculated. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to November 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between November 2014 and November 2015.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published. [A tale of many price indices][2] summarises information on the different measures.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/infographics/how-cpi-is-calculated/index.html \"How is CPI calculated?\"\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/december-2012/sty-a-tale-of-many-price-indices.html \"A tale of many price indices\"",

              "markdown": "###What is the CPI?\n\nThe CPI is a measure of consumer price inflation produced to international standards and in line with European regulations. First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][1].\n\n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between November 2014 and November 2015 stood at 0.1%. This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in November 2014 would have cost £100.10 in November 2015.\n\nSince early 2015, the CPI 12-month rate has been very close to 0.0%. This means that, taken as a whole, households have experienced very little change in prices compared with the same months in 2014. However, the picture for individual households depends on the goods and services that they buy. Looking across the year as a whole, prices for transport costs, food and non-alcoholic beverages and (to a lesser extent) recreational and cultural goods and services have had a downward pull on the rate of inflation. These have been counterbalanced by an upward pull from price movements for other goods and services, most notably restaurant and hotel bills, and education costs such as university tuition fees.\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in November 2015 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.

Table A shows the CPI 1-month rate (the amount prices change between 2 consecutive months), 12-month rate and index values for the last year.

An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. [Explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (37.1 Kb Pdf)][2] is a diagram explaining the calculation.\n\nThe CPI was little changed between October and November 2015 compared with a fall of 0.3% between the same 2 months a year earlier. The 1-month movement was therefore 0.3 percentage points higher this year compared with a year ago, leading to a rise in the CPI 12-month rate. The difference between the movements in the annual and monthly rates is due to rounding.\n\nThe largest upward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between October and November 2015 came from:\n\n- **transport: prices**, overall, fell by 0.7% between October and November this year compared with a larger fall of 1.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. As prices fell by less than last year, this resulted in an upward contribution to the CPI 12-month rate. Within transport, the upward effects came principally from motor fuels and second-hand cars. Petrol prices fell by 1.5 pence per litre this year compared with a fall of 3.0 pence per litre a year ago while diesel fell by 0.6 pence this year compared with 2.9 pence a year ago. Second-hand car prices rose by 1.6% this year compared with a fall of 1.0% a year ago.\n\n- **alcoholic beverages and tobacco**: prices, overall, fell by 0.1% between October and November this year compared with a fall of 1.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward contributions came from spirits and wine.\n\n- **miscellaneous goods and services**: prices, overall, rose by 0.3% between October and November this year compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. Some of the upward effect came from car insurance premiums which rose by more than a year ago, with Insurance Premium Tax rising from 6% to 9.5% at the start of November 2015 as announced in the Summer 2015 Budget. There was also an upward contribution from other personal effects, where prices of items such as luggage rose by more than a year ago.\n\nThe largest downward contribution to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between October and November 2015 came from:\n\n- **clothing and footwear**: prices, overall, fell by 0.1% between October and November this year compared with a rise of 0.7% between the same 2 months a year ago. This is the first fall in prices between October and November since official records began in 1996 and follows the largest September to October price increase on record. It continues the trend seen since the summer of atypical monthly price movements in the clothing and footwear sector. The contribution to change this month came primarily from price movements for a broad range of outerwear (particularly women’s trousers) with more products on sale this November than a year ago.\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.

              "markdown": "CPIH is currently undergoing re-assessment to evaluate the extent to which it meets the professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics. CPIH was first assessed in 2013. In August 2014 its National Statistics status was removed pending work to improve the methods for measuring owner occupiers’ housing costs in the index. [Full details][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website and in an [explanatory note (313.9 Kb Pdf)][2] on our website. The improvements from the resulting development work were introduced as part of the February 2015 dataset with the historical series revised back to 2005. Further information on the changes is available in 2 articles: [Improvements to the measurement of Owner Occupiers’ Housing Cost and Private Housing Rental Prices (2.48 Mb Pdf)][3] and  [Revising the weight of Owner Occupiers’ Housing in CPIH (197.4 Kb Pdf)][4].\n\nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn November 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between November 2014 and November 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.4%, up from 0.2% in October 2015. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in November 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in October, despite a small upward contribution from owner occupiers’ housing costs.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the official CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The [full assessment report][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.\n\nThe RPI is a long-standing measure of UK inflation that has historically been used for a wide range of purposes such as the indexation of pensions, rents and index-linked gilts. For further information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (100.5 Kb Pdf)][2].\n\nRPIJ is an improved variant of the Retail Prices Index, which is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn November 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.3%, up from 0.0% in the year to October 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for November 2015 stood at 1.1%, meaning that it was 0.8 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 34.2% over the 10-year period, compared with 27.1% as measured by RPIJ. The use of the Carli formula has therefore added 7.1 percentage points to the change in prices over the last 10 years.

              "markdown": "Figures in this bulletin are averaged across all UK households, unless stated otherwise.\n\nThis bulletin uses the mean when referring to averages. Therefore, total average weekly household expenditure is equal to the total weekly expenditure of households divided by the number of households. \n\nThis bulletin compares spending over time in 2 different ways, where figures are either adjusted for inflation or not adjusted for inflation. Where figures are not adjusted for inflation, differences in spending could be because of differences in price level between the years. When comparing spending that has been adjusted for inflation, differences in price between years are not a legitimate reason for differences in spending, as this has already been taken into account. Where possible, we adjust for inflation when comparing levels of spending over time. However, for more detailed expenditure items this is not possible and we therefore compare unadjusted figures. Please see the Quality and methodology section for more information on comparisons over time.\n\nChanges and differences said to be statistically significant are significant at the 95% confidence level, unless stated otherwise.\n\nThis bulletin considers expenditure by UK constituent country and English region. We combine 3 years of data when presenting spending broken down by country and region in order to improve the robustness of results.\n\nSpending is presented using classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP) categories, unless otherwise stated. COICOP is an internationally recognised classification system consistent with that used by UK National Accounts. It does not include all types of payments; for example, capital mortgage repayments are excluded. Due to high interest in this topic, this bulletin also considers housing costs outside the COICOP classification system. Further information on COICOP can be found on the [United Nations Statistics Division website][1].\n\nWe use equivalised disposable income decile groups when looking at expenditure and income together. Disposable income is defined as gross weekly cash income less the statutory deductions and payments of Income Tax and National Insurance contributions. It is used alongside expenditure as it is the amount households have available to spend or save. Equivalisation takes into account that households with many members are likely to need a higher income to achieve the same standard of living as households with fewer members. Please see the Quality and methodology section for more information on equivalisation. For ownership of durable goods, gross income decile groups are used. The standard concept of gross income is gross weekly cash income current at the time of interview; that is, before the deduction of Income Tax actually paid, National Insurance contributions and other deductions at source.\n\nResults presented in this bulletin cover the financial year ending 2016 (2015/16); that is, April 2015 to March 2016. The move to financial year comes following user demand. [Financial year ending 2015 (2014/15) tables][2] are also available to provide comparability.\n\nIn [response][3] to a recent Office for National Statistics [consultation][4], this edition of Family Spending is published as a statistical bulletin for the first time. Our users are central to the way we develop this bulletin in the future. Please [let us know][5] what you think of this new format.\n\nFamily Spending has been designated by the [UK Statistics Authority][6] as National Statistics, in accordance with the [Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007][7] and signifying compliance with the [Code of Practice for Official Statistics][8].\n\n\n  [1]: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regct.asp?Lg=1\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/bulletins/familyspendingintheuk/financialyearendingmarch2016/relateddata\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/aboutus/whatwedo/statistics/consultationsandsurveys/allconsultationsandsurveys/consultationonchangestoonsproducts2015/responsetoconsultationfinal.pdf\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/aboutus/whatwedo/statistics/consultationsandsurveys/allconsultationsandsurveys/consultationonchangestoonsproducts2015/consultationonchangestoonsproducts2015v2_tcm77-427693.doc\n  [5]: https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/ZWGLB5B\n  [6]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/national-statistician/types-of-official-statistics/\n  [7]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/uk-statistical-system/legislation/key-legislative-documents/\n  [8]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/monitoring-and-assessment/code-of-practice/\n",

              "markdown": "Total average weekly household expenditure remained level at £528.90 in the financial year ending 2016 (2015/16) when compared with the same period a year ago, where figures are adjusted for inflation.\n\nFigure 1 shows average weekly household spending, over a longer time period. \n\n####Figure 1: Total household expenditure, UK, financial year ending 2002 to financial year ending 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc389/bar_line/index.html\" />\n\nWhen considering spending that has been adjusted for inflation, Figure 1 shows that in recent years spending has increased from its lowest level of £507.20 seen in 2012. However, average spending has not returned to the pre-economic downturn levels of spending seen before 2007. It is useful to consider average expenditure alongside other economic indicators in order to understand the wider picture of the UK economy in 2015/16.\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) showed [output grew steadily in 2015/16][1] and the [employment rate][2] increased to 74.2% in Quarter 1 (January to March) of 2016, up from 73.4% in Quarter 2 (April to June) of 2015. Alongside this, [average earnings][3] and median household [disposable income][4] also grew when adjusted for inflation. However, despite an increase in median disposable income overall, disposable income grew at a slower rate for the richest fifth of households between 2014/15 and 2015/16. The median income for the richest fifth of households has actually fallen by 3.4% in real terms since the economic downturn of 2007/08.\n\nInflation shows the rate prices of goods and services bought by households rise or fall. Prices, and therefore inflation, directly influences the amount households spend. During 2015/16, inflation measured by the Consumer Prices Index [was very low][5] and even entered a period of deflation. This means that overall, goods and services were the same price or even cheaper than they were in the previous year. \n\nWe can also look at consumer confidence. Since the economic downturn, [consumer confidence][6] has been on an upward trend and began to accelerate at a quicker rate in 2013 and 2014. However, during the 2015/16 period, growth in consumer confidence began to level off. [Further breakdown][7] of consumer confidence figures suggests that this could have been driven by falling expectations of the country’s general economic situation. \n\nThese indicators suggest that despite economic growth and higher real disposable income, the average household was not influenced to spend either more or less on goods and services in 2015/16 after adjusting for inflation. This may reflect a relative weakness in consumer confidence, which may have held back spending. It may also reflect the different growth rate of real disposable household income across the income distribution. \n\n###Household expenditure by category\n\nTransport and housing (net), fuel and power were the highest expenditure classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP) categories. The average weekly amount spent on transport in the financial year ending 2016 (2015/16) was £72.70. The largest contributing factor to this was motor fuels such as petrol and diesel. Although overall spending on transport remained unchanged compared with a year ago, there were changes in lower level categories. \n\nCompared with previous years, expenditure on motor fuels decreased in 2015/16, where figures are not adjusted for inflation. [Fuel prices fell][8] in this time period following a global fall in the price of crude oil. In 2015/16, there was an increase in spending on second-hand cars or vans following an increase in [sales][9]. There was also an increase in spending on new cars or vans bought using a loan or hire purchase scheme. The increase in loans was noted by the Bank of England in the last quarter of 2015 as they [observed a rise][10] in the number of people buying goods and services on credit. The increase in the amount spent on cars is supported by what we see in [Table A45][11]. This shows that 78% of UK households owned a car or van in 2015/16, compared with 76% in the previous year. \n\nThe average weekly amount spent on housing, fuel and power was £72.50. We consider housing in more detail in [Section 5][12] of this bulletin.\n\n<ons-table path=\"8901f65a\" />\n\nFigure 2 shows the detailed level of spending within each COICOP category.\n\n####Figure 2: Household expenditure in the UK, financial year ending 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc389/treemap/index.html\" />\n\n###Household expenditure by region\n\nAs well as looking at average spending by category, we can look at regional average spending as shown by Figure 3. We combine 3 years of data when presenting spending broken down by country and region. On this basis, the average weekly household expenditure in the UK combined over financial years ending 2014, 2015 and 2016 was £527.20.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"3a7e8ddd\" />\n\nFigure 3 shows that average spending varied throughout the different regions of the UK. London had the highest average weekly household expenditure of £652.40, whilst the North East’s average weekly spending was more than £200 lower at £423.50. This is driven by housing costs, which are discussed in [Section 5][13]. For the majority of regions, transport, or housing (net), fuel and power was the highest expenditure category. However, there were some exceptions. For the North East, the North West, and Yorkshire and The Humber, households spent the most amount of money on recreation and culture. Spending on recreation and culture is explored in more depth in [Section 6][14].  \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/grossdomesticproductpreliminaryestimate/octtodec2016\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/timeseries/lf24/lms\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2016provisionalresults\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2016\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/dec2016\n  [6]: https://data.oecd.org/leadind/consumer-confidence-index-cci.htm\n  [7]: http://www.gfk.com/fileadmin/user_upload/dyna_content/GB/documents/Press_Releases/2016/GfK_Consumer_Confidence__-_December_2016.pdf\n  [8]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/oil-and-petroleum-products-monthly-statistics\n  [9]: http://www.am-online.com/news/used-cars/2015/10/21/uk-records-rapid-increase-in-used-car-sales-in-q2\n  [10]: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/other/monetary/ccs/2016/q4.aspx\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/percentageofhouseholdswithdurablegoodsuktablea45\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/bulletins/familyspendingintheuk/financialyearendingmarch2016#what-factors-influence-your-expenditure-on-housing-and-household-goods-and-services\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/bulletins/familyspendingintheuk/financialyearendingmarch2016#what-factors-influence-your-expenditure-on-housing-and-household-goods-and-services\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/bulletins/familyspendingintheuk/financialyearendingmarch2016#uk-households-spent-more-than-4500-a-week-on-restaurants-and-hotels-for-the-first-time-in-5-years",

              "markdown": "The UK average weekly spending on food and non-alcoholic drinks consumed at home was £56.80. [Table 4.1][1] shows that after adjusting for inflation, spending on food and non-alcoholic drinks has remained the same since 2011. Furthermore, spending on food and non-alcoholic drinks has made up 11% of total expenditure since 2008. Whilst all households have to spend a certain amount on food and drink, there is a limit to how much food households consume and the amount they are willing to spend overall.\n\nWe can also look at spending on food and non-alcoholic drink where figures have not been adjusted for inflation. This shows that spending on this category has decreased in the financial year ending 2016 (2015/16) because [food prices][2] fell. One of the causes of lower food prices is the emergence of discount supermarkets in the UK, which has led to [greater competition][3].\n\nIt is interesting to compare expenditure on food and non-alcoholic drinks over different income groups. Figure 4 shows that lower income households spent a higher proportion of their total expenditure on food and non-alcoholic drinks; this is similar to patterns seen in previous years. In 2015/16, households with the lowest income spent 17% of total expenditure on food and non-alcoholic drinks. In comparison, households with the highest income spent 8% of total expenditure on this category, leaving these households more money to spend elsewhere, such as on eating out.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"1c51a481\" />\n\nWe are also able to look at the proportion of total food expenditure that was spent on different types of food over the income groups. Households in the lowest income group spent 5% of their total food budget on milk while households in the highest income group spent 3%. There is a similar pattern for bread, suggesting lower income households assigned more of their food budget to basic groceries. In contrast, higher income households spent a higher proportion of their food budget on vegetables.\n\nHousing fuel, like food and drink, is essential for all UK households. In 2015/16, the [price of electricity and gas][4] fell following the fall in global oil prices. In addition to this, the UK government ran a [campaign][5] encouraging users to switch energy providers in order to get the best deal. Both of these factors would influence spending on electricity, gas and other fuels.\n\nThe 2015/16 average weekly expenditure on electricity and gas was £11.50 and £10.70 respectively. This is a reduction when comparing with the previous year, where figures are not adjusted for inflation. However, similar to food and non-alcoholic drinks, those in the lowest income groups spend a greater part of their total expenditure on electricity, gas and other fuel. Figure 5 shows that those in the lowest income group spent 9% of their total expenditure on electricity, gas and other fuels. In comparison, expenditure on housing fuel made up 3% of total expenditure for those with the highest income. This is similar to patterns seen in previous years.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"b5e929f4\" />\n\nAlthough [median household disposable income][6] rose in 2015/16, lower income households continued to spend a higher proportion of their total expenditure on food and fuel when compared with higher income households. This suggests that households with a lower income had less money to spend on non-essential items. This can be seen in [Table 3.2E][7], which shows that lower income households spent 9% of total expenditure on recreation and culture, compared with higher income households who spent 14% of expenditure on this category.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/householdexpenditureat201516pricesuktable41\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/dec2016\n  [3]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/effects-on-prices-in-the-uk/2014/sty-what-is-affecting-prices-in-the-uk-in-2014.html\n  [4]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/annual-domestic-energy-price-statistics\n  [5]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/bill-payers-missing-out-on-22bn\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2016\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/detailedhouseholdexpenditureasapercentageoftotalexpenditurebyequivaliseddisposableincomedecilegroupoecdmodifiedscaleuk32e",

              "markdown": "In this section we will look at the average weekly amount spent on housing and household goods and services. In order to provide a more complete view of housing costs, we do not use the classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP) definition of housing as some expenditure is excluded. The housing costs discussed in this section include:\n\n- net rent (that is, the amount payable by a household after housing benefits have been deducted)\n\n- mortgage payments\n\n- repairs and maintenance\n\n- home improvements\n\nExpenditure on housing fuel is considered in [Section 4][1].\n \nIn the financial year ending 2016 (2015/16), the average weekly amount spent on housing costs for UK households was £164.70. As shown in [Table 2.2][2], this is an increase on the previous year, where figures are not adjusted for inflation. \n\nSimilar to previous years, mortgages (27%), net rent (20%) and charges (18%), such as Council Tax and water charges, were the top 3 housing costs. \n\nHousing costs can differ depending on tenure. In 2015/16, the breakdown of different types of households was:\n\n- rented households (both private and social): 36%\n\n- mortgage held: 30%\n\n- owned the property outright: 34%\n\nSince 2006, there has been an increase in the number of rented households in the UK and a decrease in the number of houses being bought with a mortgage. This trend was also observed by the [English Housing Survey][3]. Despite various [government schemes][4] to help people onto the property ladder, this trend continued in 2015/16. In 2015/16, there were 6 rented households for every 5 households being bought by a mortgage holder. \n\n###Housing costs for renters and mortgage holders\n\nAs shown in [Table 2.8][5], the 2015/16 average weekly net expenditure for rent was £92.00. This averages out rent across all renting households, not all UK households. This means that 19% of a renting household’s total expenditure was spent on net rent, where net rent is the rent payment that the households have to meet themselves – benefits and rebates received by the households to help pay for rent have been subtracted. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"5406a5ae\" />\n\nFigure 6 shows that average net rent varies widely throughout the UK. The average weekly amount spent on rent in London was £167.10; this is more than double the average in the majority of other regions, excepting the East of England, South East and South West. London has the highest proportion of renters in the UK, where [nearly half of all households rent][6]. Regional rent appears correlated with [regional house prices][7], where London, East of England, South East and South West have the highest house prices. \n\nThe 2015/16 average weekly mortgage payment was higher than the average rent, at £147.60. Again, this averages out mortgage payments across all households paying a mortgage, not all UK households. Although this is higher than the average net rent, it makes up 13% of total expenditure for mortgage holders. This is 6 percentage points less than the proportion of total expenditure spent on rent by rented households. This means that although average expenditure on net rent is less than the average expenditure on mortgage payments, rented households have less money to spend on other goods and services. \n\n###Expenditure on household goods and services\n\nAs well as housing costs, we can look at the amount spent on household goods and services. This category looks at spending on items such as furniture, household appliances, cleaning materials and tools. In 2015/16, the average weekly amount spent on household goods and services was £35.50, level to the amount seen in the previous year after figures have been adjusted for inflation. Spending on furniture contributed the most to this cost, where on average a UK household spent £15.80 a week.\n\nHouseholds spent an average of £2.40 a week on household appliances. [Table A45][8] shows the percentage of households that own certain durable goods, including household appliances. In 2015/16, of all households 97% owned a washing machine and 93% owned a microwave. On the other hand, only 56% of households owned a tumble dryer and less than half of households owned a dishwasher (45%).\n\nIt is interesting to look at the ownership of these goods across income groups, as shown in [Table A46][9]. There is little difference across income groups when looking at the ownership of washing machines and microwaves. There are much bigger differences across income groups when we consider ownership of tumble dryers and dishwashers. Unlike washing machines, which can be considered a [necessity][10], tumble dryers and dishwashers can be considered to be more luxury goods. Only 14% of households in the lowest income group owned a dishwasher, compared with 84% of households in the highest income group. \n\nThis section shows that where you live, whether you rent or are buying your house with the help of a mortgage and your income influence spending on housing and household goods and services.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/bulletins/familyspendingintheuk/financialyearendingmarch2016#lower-income-households-continued-to-have-less-money-to-spend-on-non-essential-items\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/housingexpenditureuktable22\n  [3]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/501065/EHS_Headline_report_2014-15.pdf\n  [4]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/brandon-lewis-welcomes-housebuilding-surge\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/expenditureonrentbyrentersuktable28\n  [6]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/a-century-of-home-ownership-and-renting-in-england-and-wales/short-story-on-housing.html\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/housepriceindex/nov2016\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/percentageofhouseholdswithdurablegoodsuktablea45\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/percentageofhouseholdswithdurablegoodsbyincomegroupandhouseholdcompositionuktablea46\n  [10]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Material_deprivation",

High levels of [employment][2] and rising [disposable income][3] might be factors influencing this increase. \n\nThis category includes spending on goods and services such as:\n\n- restaurant and café meals (£17.30)\n\n- alcoholic drinks consumed away from home (£7.50)\n\n- takeaway meals (£4.70)\n\n- accommodation services (£8.90)\n\nMost sub-categories saw an increase in spending between the financial year ending 2015 (2014/15) and 2015/16, figures not adjusted for inflation, where spending on restaurant and café meals had the biggest contribution. However, the average weekly amount spent on restaurant and café meals varies throughout the UK when we look at 3 years of combined data. For London, the average weekly amount was £21.50, whilst households in Wales had a weekly average amount more than £7.00 lower at £14.20. This may reflect regional price differences, in addition to varying lifestyles. \n\n###Expenditure on recreation and culture\n\nRecreation and culture is another discretionary spending category. The UK average weekly spending on recreation and culture in 2015/16 was £68.00, similar to the spending seen in 2014/15 (£68.90) where figures are adjusted for inflation. This category covers a wide variety of goods and services such as:\n\n- cinema, theatre and museums and so on (£2.60)\n\n- TV subscription and licences (£6.80)\n\n- newspapers, books and stationery (£5.30)\n\n####Figure 7: Expenditure on recreation and culture in the UK, financial year ending 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc389/treemap/index.html#c9\" />\n\nAlthough spending on recreation and culture can be seen as discretionary, it was the category with the third highest expenditure in the UK. In fact, recreation and culture was the category with the highest spending for the North East, the North West, and Yorkshire and The Humber. These 3 regions spent 14% of their total expenditure on recreation and culture, compared with 11% in London. This difference was driven by the North East, North West, and Yorkshire and The Humber spending a higher proportion of expenditure on package holidays abroad.\n\nWe can look at spending on recreation and culture by age, as shown in [Table A10][4]. When we consider household spending by age, we look at the age of the person legally responsible for the household accommodation. We call this person the household reference person (HRP). \n\nTable A10 shows that households where the HRP was aged 65 to 74 spent the greatest proportion of their budgets on recreation and culture when compared with the other age categories. This age group spent 18% of their total expenditure on recreation and culture, whilst the under-30s spent 9%. Households with a HRP aged 65 to 74 spent a higher proportion of expenditure on the majority of recreation and culture sub-categories when compared with other age groups. This includes major durables, leisure classes and package holidays. This may be down to this age group having more time to spend on recreation and culture after they have retired. Interestingly, this pattern is not seen in restaurants and hotels, where spending is more equal between the age categories. \n\n###Expenditure on alcohol and tobacco \n\nThere was a significant decrease in the average weekly amount spent on alcoholic drinks and tobacco between 2014/15 and 2015/16 when we consider figures that have been adjusted for inflation. Households spent an average of £11.40 a week on this category in 2015/16; this is a decrease of a third across the decade.\n\nAlcohol and tobacco are considered to be demerit goods. These are goods that:\n\n- are [harmful][5] [to the consumer][6]\n\n- impose [costs on third parties][7]\n\nHowever, the consumer may be unaware or choose to ignore the damaging effects. In order to discourage consumption of these goods, the government can introduce a variety of measures designed to discourage consumption. This can include health awareness campaigns, legislation, taxation and minimum pricing. For example, during 2015/16, smoking in cars that contain children [was banned][8] in England and Wales. \n\nFigure 8 shows that expenditure on alcohol and tobacco has been steadily decreasing from £19.50 in 2001/02 to £11.40 in 2015/16, where figures have been adjusted for inflation. 2015/16 is the first time the weekly average amount spent on alcohol and tobacco has fallen below £12.00. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"5e3b2e75\" />\n\nWe can look at expenditure on alcoholic drinks and tobacco separately. The average weekly expenditure on alcoholic drinks in 2015/16 was £7.80. The alcoholic drinks sub-category with the largest average expenditure was wine, which made up 42% of all money spent on alcoholic drinks consumed in the home. The majority of alcoholic drink sub-categories had the same or decreased expenditure between 2014/15 and 2015/16, figures not adjusted for inflation. \n\nAverage weekly spending on tobacco in 2015/16 was £3.60; this includes £2.80 average spending on cigarettes. This is a fall of £0.30 from the 2014/15 average weekly spending on cigarettes, figures not adjusted for inflation. This decrease is likely to be caused by the continuation in the [falling numbers of smokers][9] in the UK. \n\nExpenditure on e-cigarettes was included in the sub-category of other tobacco for the first time in 2015/16. Despite this addition, average weekly spending on other tobacco remained the same between 2014/15 and 2015/16, where figures are not adjusted for inflation. This is because the introduction of e-cigarettes was off-set by a decrease in spending on other tobacco products that fall into this category, such as pipe tobacco.\n\nIt is interesting to look at the regional average weekly spending on alcohol and tobacco. We combine 3 years of data when presenting spending broken down by country and region. The average spending on alcohol and tobacco combined over financial years ending 2014, 2015 and 2016 was £11.90.\n\nAs [Table A35][10] shows, spending on alcohol and tobacco across the UK was very varied. Households in Scotland spent the most on alcoholic drinks, with an average of £8.90 a week; this is 1.8% of Scotland’s total expenditure. This was partly driven by expenditure on spirits and liqueurs, where Scottish households spent an average of £2.70 a week, compared with the UK average of £1.70. In contrast to this, London households spent 1.1% of total expenditure on alcoholic drinks. The [ethnic diversity][11] of London may contribute to the low levels of spending on alcohol in this region.\n\nExpenditure on tobacco is even more varied across the regions. The average weekly spending on cigarettes for England is £2.90, Wales £3.00, Scotland £4.90 and Northern Ireland £6.60. This clearly shows the varied picture across the UK. \n\n\n  [1]: http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=discretionary-spending\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/timeseries/lf24/lms\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2016\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/householdexpenditureasapercentageoftotalexpenditurebyageofhouseholdreferencepersonuktablea10\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/bulletins/alcoholrelateddeathsintheunitedkingdom/registeredin2014\n  [6]: http://content.digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB17526/stat-smok-eng-2015-rep.pdf\n  [7]: http://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/tobacco/docs/tobacco_liability_final_en.pdf\n  [8]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/smoking-in-vehicles\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/drugusealcoholandsmoking/datasets/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/detailedhouseholdexpenditurebycountriesandregionsuktablea35\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/ethnicity/articles/ethnicityandnationalidentityinenglandandwales/2012-12-11",

              "markdown": "In the financial year ending 2016 (2015/16), UK households spent an average of £16.00 a week on communication. This category includes spending on things such as mobile phones, telephones and postal services. UK households have spent an increasing amount of money on communication since the financial year ending 2002 as shown by Figure 9, where figures are adjusted for inflation.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"cccff652\" />\n\nAs shown in [Table A34][1], all regions spend 3% of their total expenditure on communication. Communication is the only category where the percentage of total expenditure does not vary at all between regions. \n\nIn 2015/16, over half of money spent on communication was on a mobile phone-related cost. Mobile phone ownership has dramatically increased over the last 2 decades and has overtaken landline ownership, as shown by Figure 10.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"52f7a4fb\" />\n\nFigure 10 shows that in the financial year ending 1997, only 16% of UK households owned a mobile phone. By 2015/16, this increased by 79 percentage points to reach 95%. To put this into context, 95% of UK households also have central heating, suggesting that communication devices such as mobile phones are now viewed as a necessity. \n\nAlthough the UK has seen a rapid increase in mobile phone ownership over the last 20 years, internet connection has seen an even bigger and more rapid rise. As more and more services and everyday tasks become available online, it is important that households have access to the internet. In 2015/16, of all UK households 88% had internet connection, compared with 9% of households in the late 1990s.\n\nThe percentage of households with internet connection varied across the UK, as shown in [Table A48][2]. For example, only 78% of households in Northern Ireland had internet connection, compared with 90% of households in London. It was also different across income groups, where 55% of households in the lowest income group had internet connection, compared with 100% of households in the highest income group. Although this is a large gap, it is narrowing. In 2014/15, only 51% of households in the lowest income group had internet connection. \n\nThe role of the internet is seen in other areas of household expenditure. DVD player and Blu-ray ownership has reduced from 90% in 2009 to 80% in 2015/16, suggesting that UK households are using alternate broadcast and recording methods such as TV on demand, [streaming][3] and digital recording of live TV. [Table A2][4] shows that in 2015/16, average weekly spending on online grocery shopping was £3.90, compared with £2.90 in 2014/15, figures not adjusted for inflation. This reflects the [increasing amount of goods and services bought on the internet][5]. \n\nThere is much evidence to suggest that spending in the UK has changed following the digital era experienced in recent years. However, UK households still spend money on more traditional pastimes. This includes £0.70 per week on going to the cinema, £0.80 a week on stationery and art materials and £4.60 on their pets. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/householdexpenditureasapercentageoftotalexpenditurebycountriesandregionsuktablea34\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/percentageofhouseholdswithdurablegoodsbycountriesandregionsuktablea48\n  [3]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-consumers-give-boost-to-legal-downloading-and-streaming-for-tv-films-and-music\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/expenditureonfoodandnonalcoholicdrinksbyplaceofpurchaseukfinancialyearending2016tablea2\n  [5]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rdit2/e-commerce-and-internet-use/5-facts-relating-to-web-sales/sty-5-facts.html",

The LCF is a UK household survey, designed to provide information on household expenditure patterns and food consumption.\n\nThe LCF is a voluntary sample survey of private households. Each individual in a selected household is asked to keep an expenditure diary for 2 weeks. Further information is also obtained from a household interview. The survey is continuous, interviews being spread evenly over the year to ensure that seasonal effects are covered. \n\nGreat care is taken to ensure complete confidentiality of information and to protect the identity of LCF households. Only anonymised data are supplied to users.\n\n###Sampling\n\nThe LCF sample for Great Britain is a multi-stage stratified random sample with clustering. It is drawn from the small users file of the postcode address file (PAF) – the Post Office’s list of addresses. After stratification by 2 census variables, 638 postal sectors are randomly selected and, from within these, households are sampled. \n\nA total of 11,484 households were selected in 2015/16 for the LCF in Great Britain.\n\nThe Northern Ireland sample is drawn as a random sample of addresses from the Land and Property Services Agency list. \n\n####Response \n\nGreat Britain \n\nThe overall response rate for the LCF in 2015/16 was 46% in Great Britain.\n\nBecause of the practicalities of running a voluntary survey, it is not possible to get full response from every selected household. Of the total 11,484 households in Great Britain selected for the LCF in 2015/16, there were 4,760 households that co-operated fully in the survey, including 179 households that provided sufficient information to be included as valid responses. Looking at the UK as a whole, there were 4,918 co-operating households.\n\nNorthern Ireland \n\nIn 2015/16, there were 300 sampled households, 252 of which were eligible, where 158 households gave full interviews. This gives a Northern Ireland response rate of 62%.\n\nThe [technical report][4] provides further information on response.\n\n####Estimation\n\nThe LCF employs weighting to reduce the effect of non-response bias and produce estimates of population totals and means. The weighting procedure is designed to compensate for non-response (sample-based weighting) and to adjust the sample to reflect known population totals (population-based weighting).\n\nThe [technical report][5] goes into further detail showing the effects of the weighting by comparing unweighted and weighted data from 2015/16.\n\n####Standard errors and estimates of precision \n\nThe LCF is a sample of households and not a census of the whole population. Therefore, the estimates presented in this report will differ, to some degree, from the true population values. For more information on all estimates of precision, please see the technical report.\n\nStandard errors – Standard errors provide a numerical measure of the likely difference that will arise, solely due to random chance. Standard errors for detailed expenditure items are presented in relative terms in [Table A1][6] (standard error as a percentage of the average to which it refers). \n\nConfidence intervals – Confidence intervals can be used to estimate a range within which the true population value should lie. This report presents confidence intervals at the 95% level. This means that if we used the same sampling method to select different samples and computed an interval estimate for each sample, we would expect the true population parameter to fall within the interval estimates 95% of the time.\n\nStatistical significance testing – Statistical significance testing indicates the probability with which we are confident that the difference between the estimates under examination did not occur by chance. Any significant testing carried out is at the 95% level unless otherwise stated. This means that the probability that the difference occurred by chance is low (1 in 20 or lower). \n\n####Equivalisation methodology\n\nIncome quintile and decile groups are based on a ranking of households by equivalised disposable income. Equivalisation is the process of accounting for the fact that households with many members are likely to need a higher income to achieve the same standard of living as households with fewer members. Equivalisation takes into account the number of people living in the household and their ages, acknowledging that while a household with 2 people in it will need more money to sustain the same living standards as one with a single person, the 2-person household is unlikely to need double the income.\n\nThe [Family Spending Technical Report][7] provides further detail.\n\n####Spending by region\n\nThis bulletin considers expenditure by region. We combine 3 years of data when presenting spending broken down by country and region. This is done to increase the sample size and therefore improve the robustness of results. The average for each year is summed and then the total is divided by 3. The averages used are not adjusted for inflation.\n\n####Comparisons over time\n\nThroughout this bulletin, figures are compared over time. Where possible, expenditure figures have been deflated, that is, adjusted for inflation, to allow comparison of expenditure in real terms across survey years. In this bulletin, all figures have been deflated when comparing the main classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP) categories over time. Figures not adjusted for inflation are also available for the main COICOP categories in [Table 4.3][8]. More detailed categories have not been deflated; this is stated in the commentary.\n\nFigures are deflated using the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and the indices are specific to each major COICOP category. For items that are not applicable to the CPI, for example, mortgage interest payments and Council Tax payments, the Retail Prices Index (RPI) was used. \n\nThe LCF is reviewed every year and changes are made to keep it up-to-date. Therefore, year-on-year changes should be interpreted with caution. \n\nStandard errors for categories with lower levels of spending tend to be higher, so trends for these categories need to be treated with a degree of caution.\n\nChanges and differences mentioned are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, unless stated. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/methodologies/livingcostsandfoodsurvey\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/qmis/livingcostsandfoodsurveyqmi\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/methodologies/livingcostsandfoodsurvey\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/methodologies/livingcostsandfoodsurvey\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/methodologies/livingcostsandfoodsurvey\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/componentsofhouseholdexpenditureuktablea1\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/methodologies/livingcostsandfoodsurvey\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/householdexpenditureatcurrentpricesuktable43",

Alongside this, we will introduce an additional level of detail in the Classification of Individual Consumption according to Purpose (COICOP) structure. For more information on the background and impact of these changes, please see [Assessing the impact of methodological improvements on the Consumer Prices Index][1]. These changes will be introduced in the February 2017 index, to be published in March 2017.\n\n2. ###Revisions policy\n\n\tOn 15 October 2013, a [revisions policy][2] was published for the suite of consumer price inflation statistics. The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n\n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n\n3. ###Publication policy\n\n\tThis bulletin includes the September 2016 data, collected on and around 13 September 2016. Future [publication dates][3] for this statistical bulletin are available to January 2019 (the publication of the December 2018 inflation figures).

A way to understand this is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. Movements in price indices represent the changing cost of this basket. An [infographic][1] explains how consumer price inflation is calculated, and [Consumer price indices – a brief guide][2] gives an overview of the indices and their uses. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to September 2016, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between September 2015 and September 2016.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

              "markdown": "###What is the CPI?\n\nThe CPI is a measure of consumer price inflation produced to international standards and in line with European regulations. First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (2013)][1].\n\n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n\nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between September 2015 and September 2016 stood at 1.0%. This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in September 2015 would have cost £101.00 in September 2016.\n\nThis is the highest 12-month rate since November 2014, when it was also 1.0%. At this point, the rate had begun to fall, remaining at or around zero for much of 2015 before gradually picking up from the end of the year. The largest downward pull on inflation in September 2016 and for 2016 to date comes from prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages. Upward pressures come from a variety of categories, most notably restaurant and hotel bills. Transport prices provided a downward pressure during 2015 and early 2016 but this has eased during 2016 and they now have an upward effect. \n\n[Additional analysis of the Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI): September 2016][2] also published today, presents further analysis of the September PPI and CPI headline statistics and previous trends, with a particular focus on how movements in the sterling exchange rate may have influenced these data.\n\nFigure 1 shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in September 2016 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"7c2b2c0b\" />\n\nFigure 2 shows the CPI 12-month rate for the last 10 years. Table 1 shows the CPI 1-month rate (the amount prices change between 2 consecutive months), 12-month rate and index values for the last year.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"10e35fa8\" />\n\n<ons-table path=\"c4560270\" />\n\n###Consumer Prices Index (CPI): What are the main movements?\n\nThis section explains which goods and services had the biggest impact on the change to the 12-month rate between August and September 2016 and, where relevant, considers the longer-term inflationary trends for these goods and services.\n\nThe change in the CPI 12-month rate can be calculated by comparing the 12-month rates for 2 consecutive months. An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. [Explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate (2013)][3] is a diagram explaining the calculation.\n\nThe CPI rose by 0.2% between August and September 2016, compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year earlier. The 1-month movement was therefore higher this year compared with a year ago, leading to a rise in the CPI 12-month rate.\n\nBetween August and September 2016, the main upward contributions to change in the CPI 12-month rate came from the following groups.\n\nClothing and footwear: the upward effect came primarily from garments (in particular women’s outerwear), for which prices rose by 6.0% between August and September 2016, compared with a rise of 3.3% a year ago. Whilst this rise is relatively large historically, there are factors to take into account when considering whether this is a result of sterling depreciation following the EU referendum result. First, a rise in clothing prices in September is in line with normal trends and the comparatively large increase this year follows a sustained fall in prices between March and July, with a relatively small increase into August. Second, whilst the depreciation in sterling is likely to increase the cost of importing goods and outsourcing production, there are reports of businesses having measures in place to protect against exchange rate changes in the short-term.  \n\nRestaurants and hotels: prices, overall, rose by 0.7% between August and September 2016, compared with a smaller rise of 0.2% a year ago. The upward contribution to the change in the 12-month rate was due to a rise in the price of an overnight hotel stay, compared with a fall a year ago. It is important to note that this follows an unusually large fall in August 2016. \n\nMiscellaneous goods and services: prices, overall, rose by 0.5% between August and September 2016, having been unchanged between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward effect arose from smaller upward contributions across a range of items, most notably certain appliances and products for personal care. \n\nHousing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels: overall, prices rose by 0.1% between August and September 2016, having fallen by 0.2% a year ago. The upward effect on the change in the 12-month rate came from prices for gas, which were unchanged between August and September 2016, having fallen by 2.1% between the same 2 months last year.\n\nTransport: overall, transport made a small upward contribution to the change in the rate, although this masks larger effects within the group. Rising prices for motor fuels had a large upward effect, with petrol prices increasing by 1.2 pence between August and September 2016. In 2015, fuel prices fell throughout the second half of the year. This upward effect was largely offset by prices for air fares, which fell by 24.2% between August and September 2016, compared with a smaller fall of 20.4% a year ago.  \n\nThe main downward contribution to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between August and September 2016 came from.\n\nFood and non-alcoholic beverages: overall, this group made a small downward contribution to the change in the rate. A more pronounced effect was seen for food, with prices falling by 0.3% between August and September 2016, compared with a rise of 0.1% a year ago. This was due to a combination of smaller downward effects across a range of food items. The downward contribution from food was mostly offset by rising prices for non-alcoholic beverages, having fallen between the same 2 months a year ago. \n\nFigure 3 shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"0ed5b7d7\" />\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/additionalanalysisoftheproducerpriceindexppiandconsumerpriceindexcpi/sept2016\n  [3]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/index.html",

              "markdown": "In March 2016, the National Statistician [wrote to the Chair of the UK Statistics Authority][1], setting out the intention for CPIH to become the ONS’s preferred measure of inflation.\n\nCPIH has been re-assessed to evaluate the extent to which it meets the professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics and the [assessment report][2] published on 3 March 2016. The report includes a number of requirements that need to be implemented for CPIH to regain its status as a National Statistic. The actions taken to address these requirements were reported to the UK Statistics Authority at the end of September 2016.\n\nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index. \n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words, this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable as a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 16.5% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage, the basket of goods and services and the method of deriving the weights are the same as for the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. A full description of how CPIH is compiled is given in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][3] and in various papers published on the [prices guidance and methodology webpage][4].\n\nIn September 2016, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between September 2015 and September 2016) for CPIH stood at 1.2%, up from 0.9% in August 2016. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in September 2016 was 0.2 percentage points, down from 0.3 percentage points in August. Owner occupiers’ housing costs increased by 0.1% between August and September 2016, the same as the movement between these months a year earlier. This meant that they had a negligible impact on the change in the CPIH 12-month rate between the 2 months.\n\nFigure 4 shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates for the last 10 years. The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table 2 shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The [full assessment report][1] can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.\n\nThe RPI is a long-standing measure of UK inflation that has historically been used for a wide range of purposes such as the indexation of pensions, rents and index-linked gilts. For further information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics (2013)][2].\n\nRPIJ is an improved variant of the RPI and is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between these indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn September 2016, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 1.3%, up from 1.0% in August.\nThe RPI 12-month rate for September 2016 stood at 2.0%, meaning that it was 0.7 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure 5 shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years.

The item indices behind the measurement of owner occupiers’ housing costs are included for the first time in the first quarter 2016 data. Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. Previously the data published covered January 1996 to March 2016. The data for April to June 2016 are also now available. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the November CPI is published on 13 December 2016, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to September 2016.\n\nInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each member state of the European Union (EU) according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat released figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of September 2016 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 17 October 2016. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables][7]. Further information on HICP for the EU, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][8].\n\n###Methods – CPI and other measures of inflation\n\nThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\nThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2016 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2016 Basket of Goods and Services][9]. The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2016 are available in an article published on 22 March 2016 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2016 Weights][10].\n\nRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from Tables 63 and 64 of the [Consumer Price Inflation dataset][11]. By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n\nFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index, can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][12].
