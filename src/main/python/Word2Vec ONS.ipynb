    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate how we can use [word2vec](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec) to bridge the gap between the way the ONS and the general public communicate. This is a common problem seen when users search the website for terms such as 'murder', as the ONS publishes such content under the more professional term 'homicide'.\n",

Here, we use a slimlined version of the Google News dataset for English words only, and import the data using the gensim python module as below:"

It should be noted, that the definition of each principal component is not (and need not be) necessarily well understood, as each component can in principle describe the relationship between many others.
